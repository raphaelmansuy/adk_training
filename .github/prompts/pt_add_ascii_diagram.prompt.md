## Your Task:

Read the content of the current file carefully. 

Add very high value ASCII diagrams to illustrate complex concepts, workflows, or architectures described in the text. 

Ensure the diagrams are clear, relevant, and enhance understanding of the material.

Don't use emojis or special characters that may not render properly in all environments.

Don't alter the original text; only add diagrams where they fit naturally.

```
Example Workflow for Adding ASCII Diagrams:

+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
| 1. Read Content   | --> | 2. Identify       | --> | 3. Design Diagram |
|    Carefully      |     |    Complex Parts  |     |    (ASCII Only)   |
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
         |                         |                         |
         v                         v                         v
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
| 4. Insert Diagram | --> | 5. Verify Clarity | --> | 6. Preserve      |
|    Naturally      |     |    & Relevance    |     |    Original Text |
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
```

Ensure that each box is bigger than the text inside it, and that the arrows are aligned properly. 

Verify that the diagrams do not disrupt the flow of reading and are placed where they add the most value.
