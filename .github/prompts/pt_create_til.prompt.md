Always start a tutorial with a "Why" section that explains the purpose and value of the tutorial. You must focus on what will be the gains for the learner.


Ensure the TIL is include in the index of TILs and follows the naming conventions and structure used in other TILs.

Ensure the TIL is included in the menu of the docusaurus site for easy navigation.- Ensure the TIL follows the file naming conventions (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`) and is placed in the appropriate directory.

When creating the TIL document, proceed in multiple steps:

1. Create the document with the front matter and basic structure first
2. Fill in the sections with detailed content, examples, and explanations
3. Review and refine for clarity, conciseness, and engagement
4. Ensure proper formatting and inclusion in the index and menu---
