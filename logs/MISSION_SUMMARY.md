## 🧠 Key Mental Models Created

### 1. **Agent = Human Worker System** ⭐ Core Model
```
Agent = Brain (Model) + Tools (Capabilities) + Memory (Context) 
        + Instructions (Behavior) + Workflows (Process) + Supervision (Callbacks)
```

### 2. **State vs Memory = RAM vs Hard Drive**
- State: Short-term (session/user:/app:/temp:)
- Memory: Long-term (persistent)
- Artifacts: File storage

### 3. **Three Workflow Patterns = Assembly Lines**
- Sequential: Order matters
- Parallel: Speed matters  
- Loop: Quality matters

### 4. **Tool Ecosystem Hierarchy**
FunctionTool → OpenAPIToolset → MCPToolset → Builtin → Framework Tools

### 5. **Deployment = Environment Progression**
Local (home office) → Cloud Run (small office) → Vertex AI (corporate) → GKE (factory)

### 6. **Grounding = Real-World Connection**
Web (google_search) → Data (DB) → Location (maps) → Documents (RAG)

### 7. **Streaming Modes**
- SSE: Live TV (agent → user)
- BIDI: Video call (agent ↔ user)
- NONE: Recording (batch)

### 8. **MCP = USB Protocol**
One standardized protocol for all tools

### 9. **A2A = Microservices**
Specialized agents via HTTP

### 10. **Prompt = Program Model**
System + Context + User + Tools = Program

### 11-15. Plus 5 More Advanced Models
Hierarchy, Thinking, Observability, Cost, Pattern Selection

---

## 🎯 Decision Frameworks Provided

### 1. "Which Pattern Should I Use?" - Master Decision Tree
Complete guide covering:
- Simple agents vs pipelines
- Sequential vs Parallel vs Loop
- Memory choices
- Tool selection
- Quality control
- Real-time interaction
- Deployment options
- Multi-provider integration

### 2. Tool Selection Decision Tree
```
Need capability?
├─ Python? → FunctionTool
├─ REST API? → OpenAPIToolset  
├─ Filesystem/DB? → MCPToolset
├─ Web/Maps? → Builtin
└─ Third-party? → Framework tools
```

### 3. Workflow Decision Matrix
| Scenario | Sequential | Parallel | Loop |
|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| Order matters | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Speed critical | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Quality > speed | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### 4. Deployment Decision Tree
Prototype → Local  
Low traffic → Cloud Run  
Enterprise → Vertex AI  
Custom → GKE

### 5-8. Plus 4 More Frameworks
Cost optimization, Grounding, Streaming, Observability

## 🎓 The 10 Commandments of ADK

1. **Agent = System, not just LLM**
2. **State for short-term, Memory for long-term**
3. **Sequential when order matters, Parallel when speed matters**
4. **Loop for quality, not logic**
5. **Ground everything that needs to be true**
6. **Tools are capabilities, not afterthoughts**
7. **Callbacks for control, not core logic**
8. **Start simple, add complexity when needed**
9. **Evaluate early, evaluate often**
10. **Production ≠ Development**
