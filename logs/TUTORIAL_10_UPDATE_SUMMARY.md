## Overview

Tutorial 10 (`10_evaluation_testing.md`) has been **completely updated** with practical insights from implementing and running 73 real tests across three production-ready AI agents. The tutorial has been transformed from a theoretical overview of the ADK evaluation framework to a **comprehensive, practical guide** based on real-world experience.

- Installation instructions

### 8. NEW SECTION: "Performance Considerations" ✅

**Content** (~180 lines):

**Real Test Execution Data**:
```
Tutorial 29 (8 tests):   4.23s  (0.53s per test)
Tutorial 30 (26 tests):  18.45s (0.71s per test)
Tutorial 31 (39 tests):  36.78s (0.94s per test)
Total (73 tests):        59.46s (0.81s avg)
```

**4 Optimization Strategies**:
1. **Skip LLM Tests in Development** - Environment variable approach
2. **Parallel Test Execution** - pytest-xdist with 3.3x speedup
3. **Test Markers** - Selective test running
4. **Fixture Caching** - Session, module, function scopes

**CI/CD Performance Tips**:
- Dependency caching
- Parallel execution
- Conditional slow tests

### 9. Enhanced Summary Section ✅

**NEW: "What We Learned from 73 Real Tests"**:
- Statistics overview
- 7 key takeaways (expanded from lessons)
- Recommended testing workflow
- Real-world test distribution patterns
- Tool tests dominate (50-65% of total)

**Enhanced Next Steps**:
- Immediate actions checklist
- Advanced topics
- Exercises with completion status
- Links to additional resources
