## Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Should I use pytest or ADK evaluation framework?**  
A: Use pytest for modern AG-UI agents. It's more flexible, better documented, and integrates with standard CI/CD tools.

**Q: How many tests should I write?**  
A: Focus on tools (50-60%), integration (20-30%), API (5-10%), config (10-15%). Quality over quantity.

**Q: How do I handle LLM test flakiness?**  
A: Skip LLM tests in development, use mock data for deterministic results, run LLM tests in CI/CD only.

**Q: How can I speed up tests?**  
A: Use parallel execution (`pytest -n auto`) for 3.3x speedup, skip LLM tests in dev, cache fixtures.
