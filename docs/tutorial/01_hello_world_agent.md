## Overview

Build your first AI agent with Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). This tutorial starts from absolute zero - you'll create a simple conversational agent that can chat with users. No prior ADK experience needed!

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** installed on your system
- **Terminal/command line** access
- **Google API key** - Get one free at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- Basic understanding of Python (if you can read Python, you're good!)

## Core Concepts

### What is an Agent?

An **agent** in ADK is an AI assistant powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). Think of it as a blueprint that defines:

- What the agent's purpose is (its instructions)
- Which LLM model powers it (e.g., Gemini)
- What capabilities it has (tools - we'll add these in the next tutorial)

### The Agent Class

ADK provides the `Agent` class as the modern way to define agents. It's a simple configuration object - you just tell it what you want!

## Use Case

We're building a **friendly AI assistant** that:

- Greets users warmly
- Answers general questions conversationally
- Has no special tools yet (just pure conversation)

This is the foundation - every ADK agent starts here!

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is with our working implementation:

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the tutorial implementation
cd tutorial_implementation/tutorial01

# Install dependencies and setup
make setup

# Start the agent
make dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and select "hello_agent"!

### Quick Demo

Here's what your agent looks like in action:

## Step-by-Step Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to build it yourself, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Installation

Open your terminal and install ADK:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

This installs the complete ADK toolkit including the Dev UI, CLI tools, and all dependencies.

### Step 2: Create Project Structure

ADK requires a specific folder structure. Create a new directory for your agent:

```bash
# Create the agent directory
mkdir hello_agent
cd hello_agent

# Create the required Python files
touch __init__.py agent.py .env
```

Your folder structure should look like this:

```text
hello_agent/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py    # Makes this a Python package
â”œâ”€â”€ agent.py       # Your agent definition
â””â”€â”€ .env          # Authentication credentials
```

### Step 3: Configure Authentication

Open `.env` in your text editor and add your Google AI Studio API key:

#### hello_agent/.env

```bash
# Using Google AI Studio (recommended for learning)
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Step 4: Set Up Package Import

Open `__init__.py` and add this single line:

#### hello_agent/**init**.py

```python
from . import agent
```

This line tells ADK where to find your agent definition. It's required!

### Step 5: Define Your Agent

Now for the exciting part! Open `agent.py` and create your agent:

#### hello_agent/agent.py

```python
# Required by ADK for proper Python type hints
from __future__ import annotations

# Import the Agent class
from google.adk.agents import Agent

# Define your agent - MUST be named 'root_agent'
root_agent = Agent(
    name="hello_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="A friendly AI assistant for general conversation",
    instruction=(
        "You are a warm and helpful assistant. "
        "Greet users enthusiastically and answer their questions clearly. "
        "Be conversational and friendly!"
    )
)
```

### Code Explanation

- **`from __future__ import annotations`**: ADK convention for better type handling
- **`Agent`**: The modern ADK agent class (replaces older `LlmAgent`)
- **`name`**: Internal identifier for your agent
- **`model`**: Which LLM to use - `gemini-2.0-flash` is fast and cost-effective
- **`description`**: Brief summary of what your agent does
- **`instruction`**: Detailed behavioral instructions for the LLM
- **`root_agent`**: MUST use this exact variable name - ADK looks for it!

### Step 6: Run Your Agent

Navigate to the **parent directory** of `hello_agent`:

```bash
cd ..  # Go up one level, so you're in the folder that contains hello_agent/
```

### Option 1: Dev UI (Recommended for Learning)

Launch the interactive development interface:

```bash
adk web
```

This starts a web server. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` and:

1. **Select your agent**: Choose "hello_agent" from the dropdown in the top-left
2. **Start chatting**: Type a message in the chat box
3. **Explore Events tab**: Click "Events" on the left to see exactly what the LLM received and returned

**Try these prompts:**

- "Hello!"
- "What can you help me with?"
- "Tell me a joke"

### Option 2: Command Line

For quick testing in the terminal:

```bash
adk run hello_agent
```

Type your message when prompted, and the agent will respond.

## Understanding What's Happening

When you send a message to your agent:

1. **ADK packages your message** along with the agent's instructions
2. **Sends it to Gemini** (the LLM specified in `model`)
3. **Gemini generates a response** based on the instructions
4. **ADK returns the response** to you

**Use the Events tab** in the Dev UI to see this flow in detail - it shows you the exact prompts and responses!

## Expected Behavior

```text
You: Hello!
Agent: Hello! It's great to hear from you! How can I help you today?

You: What can you do?
Agent: I'm here to chat and answer your questions! I can help with general
       information, have conversations, explain concepts, or just be a
       friendly companion. What would you like to talk about?
```

## Key Takeaways

âœ… **ADK agents are just configuration** - you define what you want, ADK handles the rest

âœ… **Canonical structure required** - `__init__.py`, `agent.py`, `.env` in a directory

âœ… **Variable must be named `root_agent`** - ADK looks for this exact name

âœ… **Use `Agent` class** - it's the modern, recommended approach

âœ… **Dev UI is your friend** - the Events tab shows exactly what's happening under the hood

âœ… **Authentication via .env** - keep your API keys safe and out of code

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem**: "Agent not found in dropdown"

- **Solution**: Make sure you're running `adk web` from the parent directory that contains `hello_agent/`

**Problem**: "Authentication error"

- **Solution**: Check your `.env` file has the correct API key and `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE`

**Problem**: "Module not found"

- **Solution**: Verify `__init__.py` contains `from . import agent`

**Problem**: "root_agent not found"

- **Solution**: Your variable in `agent.py` must be exactly named `root_agent`

## What We Built

You now have a fully functional AI agent! It can:

- Hold natural conversations
- Respond to questions contextually
- Remember the conversation history during a session

But it's limited to what the LLM knows. In the next tutorial, we'll give it **superpowers** by adding custom tools!

### `hello_agent/__init__.py`

```python
from . import agent
```

### `hello_agent/.env`

```bash
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### `hello_agent/agent.py`

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from google.adk.agents import Agent

root_agent = Agent(
    name="hello_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="A friendly AI assistant for general conversation",
    instruction=(
        "You are a warm and helpful assistant. "
        "Greet users enthusiastically and answer their questions clearly. "
        "Be conversational and friendly!"
    )
)
```

Congratulations! You've built your first ADK agent! ðŸŽ‰
