# Tutorial 06: Multi-Agent Systems - Agents Working Together

## Overview

This demonstrates the fan-out/gather pattern - parallel data gathering + sequential synthesis!

## Step 1: Get the Working Implementation

A complete, tested implementation is available in the repository:

```bash
# Navigate to the working implementation
cd tutorial_implementation/tutorial06/

# Install dependencies
make setup

# Copy environment template and add your API key
cp content_publisher/.env.example content_publisher/.env
# Edit content_publisher/.env and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

**Alternative**: Follow the step-by-step build instructions below to create your own implementation.

## Step 2: Create Project Structure (Optional - Skip if using working implementation)

If you prefer to build from scratch, create this structure:

```bash
mkdir content_publisher
cd content_publisher
touch __init__.py agent.py .env
```

Copy your `.env` file from previous tutorials.e art of combining Sequential and Parallel agents to build sophisticated multi-agent systems! This tutorial brings together everything you've learned to create production-ready agent architectures that can handle complex, real-world tasks.

**üéØ Working Implementation Available**: A complete, tested content publishing system is available at [`tutorial_implementation/tutorial06/`](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/adk_training/tree/main/tutorial_implementation/tutorial06). The implementation includes comprehensive tests, documentation, and a user-friendly setup process.

## Prerequisites

- **Completed Tutorials 01-05** - Understanding of agents, tools, Sequential, and Parallel patterns
- **Installed ADK** - `pip install google-adk`
- **API key configured** - From Tutorial 01
- **GoogleSearch tool access** - Available with Gemini 2.0+ models (automatically enabled)

## Core Concepts

### Multi-Agent Architecture

Real-world problems need **multiple agents working together** in sophisticated ways:

- **Sequential chains** (Tutorial 04) - Order matters: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C
- **Parallel branches** (Tutorial 05) - Speed matters: A, B, C run together
- **Nested orchestration** - Combining both: Parallel inside Sequential, or vice versa
- **Specialized agents** - Each agent has ONE focused responsibility

### Common Multi-Agent Patterns

**Pattern 1: Sequential Pipeline**
```
Agent A ‚Üí Agent B ‚Üí Agent C
```
*Use when*: Each step needs previous step's output

**Pattern 2: Fan-Out/Gather**
```
     ‚îå‚îÄ Agent A ‚îÄ‚îê
In ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ Agent B ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚Üí Merger ‚Üí Out
     ‚îî‚îÄ Agent C ‚îÄ‚îò
```
*Use when*: Gather data from multiple sources, then synthesize

**Pattern 3: Nested Workflows** (This Tutorial!)
```
       ‚îå‚îÄ Sequential: A ‚Üí B ‚îÄ‚îê
In ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ Sequential: C ‚Üí D ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚Üí Final Agent ‚Üí Out
       ‚îî‚îÄ Sequential: E ‚Üí F ‚îÄ‚îò
       
     Parallel Container
```
*Use when*: Multiple independent pipelines, then final synthesis

### Real Research with GoogleSearch Tool

**üéØ Enhanced with Real Web Search**: This tutorial now uses ADK's builtin `google_search` tool to perform actual web research instead of simulated responses. This makes the content publishing system much more powerful and realistic!

The GoogleSearch tool automatically:
- Searches the web for current, relevant information
- Provides factual, up-to-date data from credible sources
- Works seamlessly with Gemini 2.0+ models
- No additional setup required beyond your API key

**Why Real Search Matters:**
- ‚úÖ **Authentic content** - Based on actual web research
- ‚úÖ **Current information** - Always up-to-date with latest news
- ‚úÖ **Credible sources** - Draws from real websites and publications
- ‚úÖ **Educational value** - Shows how to build production-ready research systems

## Use Case

We're building a **Content Publishing System** for a digital magazine that needs to:

1. **Research Phase** (3 parallel pipelines):
   - *News Pipeline*: Fetch current events ‚Üí Summarize key points
   - *Social Pipeline*: Gather trending topics ‚Üí Analyze sentiment
   - *Expert Pipeline*: Find expert opinions ‚Üí Extract quotes
   
2. **Content Creation Phase** (sequential):
   - Combine all research
   - Write article draft
   - Edit for clarity
   - Format for publication

This demonstrates **nested orchestration**: 3 parallel sequential pipelines + final sequential synthesis!

## Step 1: Create Project Structure

```bash
mkdir content_publisher
cd content_publisher
touch __init__.py agent.py .env
```

Copy your `.env` file from previous tutorials.

## Step 2: Set Up Package Import

**content_publisher/__init__.py**
```python
from . import agent
```

## Step 3: Build the Multi-Agent System

**content_publisher/agent.py**
```python
from __future__ import annotations

**Why This Architecture Works:**

1. **Phase 1 (Parallel Research)**:
   - 3 independent research areas (news, social, expert)
   - Each has 2-step pipeline (gather ‚Üí process)
   - All 3 pipelines run simultaneously = FAST
   
2. **Phase 2 (Sequential Creation)**:
   - Writer NEEDS all 3 research outputs
   - Editor NEEDS writer's draft
   - Formatter NEEDS editor's version
   - Must run in order = QUALITY

3. **Best of Both Worlds**:
   - Speed from parallelism (research phase)
   - Quality from sequential flow (creation phase)

## Step 4: Run the Publishing System

### Using the Working Implementation

```bash
# From tutorial_implementation/tutorial06/
make dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` and select "content_publisher".

### Manual Setup (if building from scratch)

Navigate to parent directory and launch:

```bash
cd ..  # Go to parent of content_publisher/
adk web
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` and select "content_publisher".

### Try These Prompts

**Technology Topic:**
```
Write an article about artificial intelligence in healthcare
```

**Current Events:**
```
Create an article about renewable energy adoption
```

**Business Topic:**
```
Write about the future of remote work
```

**Science Topic:**
```
Create an article explaining quantum computing breakthroughs
```

## Understanding the Execution Flow

Open the **Events tab** to see the sophisticated orchestration:

**Phase 1: Parallel Research Starts**
1. Event: ParallelResearch starts
2. Events (ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY):
   - NewsPipeline starts
     - news_fetcher runs
     - news_summarizer runs  
   - SocialPipeline starts
     - social_monitor runs
     - sentiment_analyzer runs
   - ExpertPipeline starts
     - expert_finder runs
     - quote_extractor runs
3. Event: ParallelResearch completes (when ALL 3 pipelines done)

**Phase 2: Sequential Content Creation**
4. Event: article_writer starts (with all 3 research outputs injected)
5. Event: article_writer completes
6. Event: article_editor starts (with draft)
7. Event: article_editor completes
8. Event: article_formatter starts (with edited version)
9. Event: article_formatter completes ‚Üí DONE!

Watch how 6 agents in Phase 1 run concurrently, then 3 agents in Phase 2 run sequentially!

## Testing Your Implementation

The working implementation includes comprehensive tests to validate your understanding:

```bash
# From tutorial_implementation/tutorial06/
make test
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Individual agent configurations (9 agents)
- ‚úÖ Sequential pipeline structures (3 pipelines)
- ‚úÖ Parallel research orchestration
- ‚úÖ Complete system integration
- ‚úÖ State management and data flow
- ‚úÖ Import validation and module structure
- ‚úÖ Project file organization

**Quick Demo:**
```bash
# Test basic functionality without full ADK setup
make demo
```

This validates that your agents load correctly and the pipeline structure is sound.

## Expected Behavior

**Example: "Write an article about electric vehicles"**

```
User: Write an article about electric vehicles

**Note**: Actual search results will vary based on current events and web content at the time of execution. The system now performs real Google searches for authentic, up-to-date information!

## How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

**Nested Agent Execution:**

1. **Outer SequentialAgent** controls main phases:
   - sub_agents = [parallel_research, writer, editor, formatter]
   
2. **parallel_research (ParallelAgent)** runs 3 sub-agents concurrently:
   - Each sub-agent is itself a SequentialAgent!
   - NewsPipeline runs: fetcher ‚Üí summarizer
   - SocialPipeline runs: monitor ‚Üí analyzer
   - ExpertPipeline runs: finder ‚Üí extractor
   
3. **State Management**:
   - Each pipeline saves to its own output_key
   - Writer reads &#123;news_summary&#125;, &#123;social_insights&#125;, &#123;expert_quotes&#125;
   - Editor reads &#123;draft_article&#125;
   - Formatter reads &#123;edited_article&#125;

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Without parallelism**: ~60 seconds (6 research agents + 3 creation agents)
- **With parallelism**: ~25 seconds (6 research agents run together!)
- **Speedup**: ~2.4x faster

## Key Takeaways

‚úÖ **Nest Sequential inside Parallel** - Multiple independent pipelines running concurrently

‚úÖ **Nest Parallel inside Sequential** - Phases of work where one phase needs parallelism

‚úÖ **Each agent has ONE job** - Specialized, focused, testable

‚úÖ **State flows through output_keys** - Explicit data dependencies

‚úÖ **Sophisticated orchestration is simple** - Just compose Sequential + Parallel

‚úÖ **Real performance gains** - Parallel research phase is 3x faster

‚úÖ **Production-ready patterns** - Used in real content systems, data pipelines, analysis tools

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Draw your architecture before coding (visualize the flow!)
- Keep agents focused (one clear responsibility)
- Use descriptive names (news_fetcher, not agent1)
- Plan state flow (what keys does each agent need?)
- Test individual pipelines before composing
- Monitor Events tab to verify execution

**DON'T:**
- Over-nest (3+ levels deep gets confusing)
- Create agents that do multiple things
- Forget to set output_keys (breaks state flow!)
- Assume execution order in parallel blocks
- Skip the planning phase (complexity needs design!)

## Common Issues

**Problem**: "Agents in parallel block seem to run sequentially"
- **Solution**: Check Events tab for actual start times
- **Solution**: Model API might be rate-limiting concurrent requests

**Problem**: "Writer agent missing research data"
- **Solution**: Verify each pipeline sets its output_key
- **Solution**: Check &#123;key&#125; names in writer instruction match exactly

**Problem**: "One research pipeline fails, whole system stops"
- **Solution**: ParallelAgent waits for ALL - one failure blocks
- **Solution**: Add error handling or retry logic to individual agents

**Problem**: "Hard to debug nested agents"
- **Solution**: Test each pipeline individually first
- **Solution**: Use Events tab to trace execution flow
- **Solution**: Add descriptive agent names and descriptions

## What We Built

You now have a production-grade content publishing system that:
- Researches from 3 independent sources concurrently
- Processes each source with specialized pipelines
- Synthesizes everything into publication-ready content
- Demonstrates sophisticated multi-agent orchestration

And you understand how to architect complex agent systems!

## Real-World Applications

**Multi-Agent Systems Are Perfect For:**

- **Content Platforms**: Research ‚Üí Write ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Publish (this tutorial!)
- **Data Analysis**: Gather data (parallel) ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Visualize
- **E-Commerce**: Check inventory + pricing + reviews (parallel) ‚Üí Recommend
- **Customer Support**: Classify ‚Üí Route (parallel specialists) ‚Üí Respond ‚Üí Follow-up
- **Financial Analysis**: Market data + news + sentiment (parallel) ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Report
- **Code Generation**: Design + Implement + Review + Test + Document

## Exercises (Try On Your Own!)

1. **Add more research pipelines** - Academic papers, patent databases, competitor analysis
2. **Conditional routing** - Have a classifier decide which pipelines to run
3. **Quality control** - Add a fact-checker agent before publication
4. **A/B testing** - Run 2 parallel writer agents, have editor choose best
5. **Nested parallel** - Make each research pipeline spawn its own parallel sub-agents
