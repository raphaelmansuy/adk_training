# Tutorial 07: Loop Agents - Iterative Refinement with Critic/Refiner Patterns

## Overview

Learn how to build self-improving agent systems using **`LoopAgent`**! This tutorial teaches you iterative refinement patterns - perfect for when quality matters more than speed. Build agents that critique their own work and keep improving until it's excellent.

**🎯 Working Implementation Available**: A complete, tested essay refinement system is available at [`tutorial_implementation/tutorial07/`](../tutorial_implementation/tutorial07/). The implementation includes comprehensive tests, documentation, and a user-friendly setup process.

**🚀 Quick Start**: Want to see it in action immediately? Jump to the [Complete Working Code](#complete-code-reference) section below!

## Prerequisites

- **Completed Tutorials 01-06** - Understanding of agents, workflows, and multi-agent systems
- **Installed ADK** - `pip install google-adk`
- **API key configured** - From Tutorial 01

## Core Concepts

### LoopAgent

The **`LoopAgent`** executes sub-agents **iteratively** (in a loop) for refinement and quality improvement. Unlike Sequential (runs once) or Parallel (runs concurrently), Loop runs the same agents **multiple times** until quality is sufficient or a limit is reached.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Executes sub-agents repeatedly in a loop
- Deterministic (not LLM-powered - just loop logic)
- MUST have termination conditions (prevent infinite loops!)
- Perfect for iterative refinement and self-improvement

### The Critic → Refiner Pattern

The most common and powerful loop pattern:

```
1. Critic: Evaluates current quality
2. Refiner: Improves based on critique
3. REPEAT until quality sufficient or max iterations
```

**Why This Works:**

- Critic provides objective feedback
- Refiner focuses on applying improvements
- Separation of concerns (evaluate vs improve)
- Iterative approach improves quality over time

### Termination Strategies

**YOU must prevent infinite loops!** Three strategies:

**Strategy 1: Max Iterations (Safety Net)**

```python
loop = LoopAgent(
    sub_agents=[critic, refiner],
    max_iterations=5  # Stops after 5 iterations MAX
)
```

Always have this as a safety limit!

**Strategy 2: Exit Tool (Smart Termination)**

```python
def exit_loop(tool_context: ToolContext):
    """Signal that refinement is complete."""
    tool_context.actions.end_of_agent = True
    return {"text": "Loop exited successfully. The agent has determined the task is complete."}

refiner = Agent(
    tools=[exit_loop],
    instruction="If critic says 'APPROVED', call exit_loop"
)
```

Allows early exit when quality is good!

**Strategy 3: Combination (Best Practice)**

Use BOTH - exit tool for early termination, max_iterations as safety:

```python
loop = LoopAgent(
    sub_agents=[critic_with_approval, refiner_with_exit_tool],
    max_iterations=5  # Safety limit
)
# Loop exits when:
# - exit_loop called (quality good!) OR
# - 5 iterations reached (safety limit)
```

### When to Use Loop Agents

Use `LoopAgent` when:

- ✅ Quality improvement through iteration
- ✅ Self-correcting systems (write → review → fix → repeat)
- ✅ Retry logic with validation
- ✅ Gradual refinement (each iteration improves)

Don't use when:

- ❌ Single pass is sufficient
- ❌ No clear improvement metric
- ❌ Speed is more important than quality

## Use Case

We're building an **Essay Refinement System** that:

1. **Initial Writer** - Creates first draft (runs once)
2. **Refinement Loop** - Repeats until essay is excellent:
   - *Critic*: Evaluates essay quality, gives specific feedback
   - *Refiner*: Applies improvements OR signals completion

This demonstrates the classic critic → refiner loop pattern!

## Step 1: Create Project Structure

```bash
mkdir essay_refiner
cd essay_refiner
touch __init__.py agent.py .env
```

Copy your `.env` file from previous tutorials.

## Step 2: Set Up Package Import

**essay_refiner/__init__.py**

```python
from . import agent
```

## Step 3: Build the Loop-Based Refiner

**essay_refiner/agent.py**

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from google.adk.agents import Agent, LoopAgent, SequentialAgent
from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext

# ===== Exit Tool for Loop Termination =====
def exit_loop(tool_context: ToolContext):
    """
    Signal that the essay refinement is complete.
    Called by the refiner when critic approves the essay.
    """
    print(f"  [Exit Loop] Called by {tool_context.agent_name} - Essay approved!")
    tool_context.actions.end_of_agent = True  # Signal to stop looping
    # Return a minimal valid content part so the backend always produces a valid LlmResponse
    return {"text": "Loop exited successfully. The agent has determined the task is complete."}

### Code Breakdown

**Execution Flow:**

```
User: "Write an essay about climate change"
    ↓
Initial Writer (runs ONCE):
    → Writes first draft → state['current_essay'] = "Climate change is..."
    ↓
Refinement Loop (iterates):
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Iteration 1:                        │
    │   Critic: Evaluates draft           │
    │   → state['critique'] = "Thesis    │
    │      vague, add examples..."        │
    │   Refiner: Reads critique           │
    │   → Applies improvements            │
    │   → state['current_essay'] =        │
    │      improved version               │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ Iteration 2:                        │
    │   Critic: Evaluates improved essay  │
    │   → state['critique'] = "Good,     │
    │      but conclusion weak..."        │
    │   Refiner: Improves conclusion      │
    │   → state['current_essay'] =        │
    │      even better version            │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ Iteration 3:                        │
    │   Critic: Evaluates again           │
    │   → state['critique'] = "APPROVED  │
    │      - Essay is complete."          │
    │   Refiner: Sees APPROVED            │
    │   → Calls exit_loop() ✅            │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Loop exits (early termination - only 3 iterations!)
    ↓
Final Output: Refined essay from state['current_essay']
```

**Key Patterns:**

1. **State Overwriting**: `refiner` uses same `output_key` as `initial_writer`
   - Each iteration overwrites the essay with improved version
   - Critic always evaluates the LATEST version

2. **Exit Tool Pattern**:
   - Critic outputs special phrase "APPROVED..."
   - Refiner detects phrase and calls `exit_loop()`
   - `tool_context.actions.end_of_agent = True` signals stop
   
3. **Safety Net**: `max_iterations=5` prevents infinite loop if approval never comes

## Step 4: Run the Essay Refiner

Navigate to parent directory and launch:

```bash
cd ..  # Go to parent of essay_refiner/
adk web
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` and select "essay_refiner".

### Try These Prompts

**Basic Essay:**

```
Write an essay about the importance of education
```

**Technical Topic:**

```

```

**Argumentative:**

```

```

**Creative:**

```

```

## Understanding Loop Execution

Open the **Events tab** to watch the iterative refinement:

1. **Event**: InitialWriter starts
2. **Event**: InitialWriter completes → first draft created
3. **Event**: RefinementLoop starts
4. **Iteration 1**:
   - Event: Critic starts
   - Event: Critic completes → feedback generated
   - Event: Refiner starts
   - Event: Refiner completes → essay improved
5. **Iteration 2**:
   - Event: Critic starts (evaluates improved version)
   - Event: Critic completes
   - Event: Refiner starts
   - Event: Refiner completes
6. **Iteration 3**:
   - Event: Critic starts
   - Event: Critic completes → outputs "APPROVED"
   - Event: Refiner starts
   - Event: Refiner calls exit_loop ✅
7. **Event**: RefinementLoop completes (early exit!)

**Notice**: Loop can exit early (3 iterations) OR hit safety limit (5 iterations)

## Expected Behavior

**Example: "Write an essay about climate change"**

```
User: Write an essay about climate change

[Initial Writer creates first draft]

First Draft:
Climate change is a problem. It affects the environment. We should do something 
about it. Many scientists agree.

[Refinement Loop - Iteration 1]
Critic: "Thesis is too vague. Add specific examples of climate change impacts. 
Strengthen the conclusion with concrete actions."

Refiner: [Improves essay]

Improved Draft (v2):
Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity, 
with rising global temperatures causing unprecedented weather patterns and ecosystem 
disruption...

[Refinement Loop - Iteration 2]
Critic: "Much better! Consider adding transition sentences between paragraphs. 
The conclusion could be stronger."

Refiner: [Improves transitions and conclusion]

Improved Draft (v3):
Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity...
[Better transitions added]
Therefore, immediate action combining policy changes, technological innovation, 
and individual responsibility is essential...

[Refinement Loop - Iteration 3]
Critic: "APPROVED - Essay is complete."

Refiner: [Calls exit_loop]

Final Output: [Displays refined version 3]
```

**Result**: 3 iterations produced a high-quality essay!

## How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

**Loop Mechanics:**

1. **LoopAgent.sub_agents** = [critic, refiner]
2. **First iteration**:
   - Run critic → saves to state['critique']
   - Run refiner → reads critique, saves to state['current_essay']
3. **Next iteration**:
   - Run critic AGAIN → evaluates NEW state['current_essay']
   - Run refiner AGAIN → either improves OR calls exit_loop
4. **Continue** until:
   - `exit_loop()` called → `tool_context.actions.end_of_agent = True`
   - OR `max_iterations` reached

**Tool Context Actions:**

```python
def exit_loop(tool_context: ToolContext):
    tool_context.actions.end_of_agent = True  # THIS stops the loop!
    return {"text": "Loop exited successfully. The agent has determined the task is complete."}
```

When end_of_agent=True, ADK stops the LoopAgent immediately.

**State Overwriting Pattern:**

- Initial writer: `output_key="current_essay"` → Creates
- Refiner: `output_key="current_essay"` → Overwrites each iteration
- Critic: Reads `{current_essay}` → Always gets latest version

## Key Takeaways

✅ **LoopAgent enables iterative refinement** - Quality improves over iterations

✅ **Critic → Refiner is the pattern** - Separate evaluation from improvement

✅ **MUST have termination** - exit_loop tool + max_iterations

✅ **State overwriting** - Same output_key creates versioning

✅ **Early exit saves time** - Don't waste iterations if quality is good

✅ **Safety net essential** - max_iterations prevents infinite loops

✅ **Tool escalation** - `tool_context.actions.end_of_agent = True` stops loop

## Best Practices

**DO:**

- Always set `max_iterations` as safety net
- Use exit tool for intelligent early termination
- Keep loop simple (2-3 agents max)
- Test termination conditions thoroughly
- Use descriptive approval phrases (not just "yes")
- Monitor iteration count in Events tab

**DON'T:**

- Forget max_iterations (infinite loop risk!)
- Put too many agents in loop (complexity!)
- Assume loop will always exit early
- Use loops when single-pass is sufficient
- Make termination condition too strict (might never exit early)

## Common Issues

**Problem**: "Loop runs all 5 iterations even though quality is good"

- **Solution**: Check refiner is correctly detecting approval phrase
- **Solution**: Verify exit_loop tool is properly called
- **Solution**: Check for typos in approval phrase matching

**Problem**: "Loop exits immediately on first iteration"

- **Solution**: Critic might be too lenient (always approving)
- **Solution**: Check critique instruction is properly evaluating

**Problem**: "Loop never exits early, always hits max"

- **Solution**: Critic might be too harsh (never approving)
- **Solution**: Refiner might not be calling exit_loop correctly
- **Solution**: Lower max_iterations to test faster

**Problem**: "State not updating between iterations"

- **Solution**: Check refiner has `output_key="current_essay"`
- **Solution**: Verify same key name used consistently

## What We Built

You now have a self-improving essay system that:

- Writes initial drafts quickly
