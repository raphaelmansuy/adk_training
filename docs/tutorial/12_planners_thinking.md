# Tutorial 12: Planners & Thinking Configuration

**Goal**: Master advanced reasoning capabilities using Built-in Planners, Thinking Configuration, and structured Plan-ReAct patterns for complex problem-solving.

**Prerequisites**:
- Tutorial 01 (Hello World Agent)
- Tutorial 02 (Function Tools)
- Gemini 2.0+ model access

**What You'll Learn**:
- Using `BuiltInPlanner` with extended thinking
- Implementing `PlanReActPlanner` for structured reasoning
- Configuring `ThinkingConfig` for transparent reasoning
- Creating custom planners with `BasePlanner`
- Building agents that plan before acting
- Understanding when to use which planner

**Time to Complete**: 50-65 minutes

---

## Why Planners Matter

Default agents react immediately to queries. **Planners** add a crucial step: **thinking before acting**. This leads to:

- üß† **Better Reasoning**: Multi-step problem decomposition
- üéØ **Improved Accuracy**: Plan validation before execution
- üîç **Transparent Thinking**: See how agent reasons
- üîÑ **Dynamic Replanning**: Adjust strategy based on results
- üí° **Complex Problem Solving**: Handle multi-faceted challenges

**Without Planner** (Direct Response):
```
User: "Plan a trip to Japan"
Agent: "Here's a trip plan..." [Immediate response]
```

**With Planner** (Structured Reasoning):
```
User: "Plan a trip to Japan"
Agent:
  <PLAN>
  1. Understand requirements (budget, duration, interests)
  2. Research destinations
  3. Create itinerary
  4. Estimate costs
  5. Provide recommendations
  </PLAN>
  
  <REASONING>
  Need to gather info first, then plan systematically...
  </REASONING>
  
  <ACTION>
  Let me start by asking about your preferences...
  </ACTION>
```

## 1. BuiltInPlanner (Extended Thinking)

### What is BuiltInPlanner?

`BuiltInPlanner` leverages Gemini 2.0+'s **native thinking capabilities** - the model performs extended reasoning internally before generating responses.

**Source**: `google/adk/planners/built_in_planner.py`

### Basic Usage

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.planners import BuiltInPlanner
from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.genai import types

# Create agent with extended thinking
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',  # Requires Gemini 2.0+ with thinking support
    name='thoughtful_assistant',
    instruction='You are a helpful assistant that thinks carefully before responding.',
    planner=BuiltInPlanner(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(
            include_thoughts=True  # Show reasoning to user
        )
    )
)

runner = Runner()
result = runner.run(
    "How would you solve world hunger?",
    agent=agent
)

print(result.content.parts[0].text)
# Includes model's reasoning process
```

**Output includes thinking**:
```
[Thinking]
This is a complex global issue requiring multi-faceted approach.
I need to consider:
- Agricultural technology
- Distribution systems
- Economic factors
- Political will
- Climate change impact

Let me structure this systematically...
[End Thinking]

Based on my analysis, here are key strategies to address world hunger:
1. Improve agricultural productivity in developing regions...
2. Reduce food waste through better supply chains...
...
```

### ThinkingConfig Options

```python
from google.genai import types

# Show thinking to user
thinking_config = types.ThinkingConfig(
    include_thoughts=True  # User sees reasoning
)

# Hide thinking (just final answer)
thinking_config = types.ThinkingConfig(
    include_thoughts=False  # Only final answer shown
)
```

**When to show thinking**:
- ‚úÖ Educational applications (teach reasoning)
- ‚úÖ Debugging agent logic
- ‚úÖ Building trust (transparent AI)
- ‚úÖ Complex problem explanations

**When to hide thinking**:
- ‚úÖ Production user-facing apps
- ‚úÖ When users want quick answers
- ‚úÖ API responses (efficiency)
- ‚úÖ When thinking adds no value

### How It Works Internally

```python
# Simplified implementation from BuiltInPlanner
class BuiltInPlanner(BasePlanner):
    def __init__(self, thinking_config: types.ThinkingConfig = None):
        self.thinking_config = thinking_config or types.ThinkingConfig()
    
    def apply_thinking_config(self, llm_request: LlmRequest):
        """Apply thinking config to LLM request."""
        if self.thinking_config:
            llm_request.config.thinking_config = self.thinking_config
        return llm_request
```

### Model Compatibility

```python
# ‚úÖ Works with Gemini 2.0+ models supporting thinking
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=BuiltInPlanner(thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(include_thoughts=True))
)

# ‚ùå May not work with models without thinking support
# Check model capabilities before using
```

---

## 2. PlanReActPlanner (Structured Reasoning)

### What is PlanReActPlanner?

`PlanReActPlanner` implements the **Plan-ReAct pattern**: Plan ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Observe ‚Üí Replan. This creates a structured reasoning loop.

**Source**: `google/adk/planners/plan_re_act_planner.py`

### Basic Usage

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.planners import PlanReActPlanner
from google.adk.runners import Runner

# Create agent with Plan-ReAct pattern
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='systematic_planner',
    instruction='You solve problems systematically using planning and reasoning.',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner()
)

runner = Runner()
result = runner.run(
    "Build a machine learning model to predict house prices",
    agent=agent
)

print(result.content.parts[0].text)
```

**Output structure**:
```
<PLANNING>
To build a house price prediction model, I need to:
1. Gather and clean housing data
2. Select relevant features (size, location, age, etc.)
3. Choose appropriate algorithm (regression)
4. Train and validate model
5. Evaluate performance
</PLANNING>

<REASONING>
For this problem:
- Linear regression suitable for continuous price prediction
- Need features like square footage, bedrooms, location
- Must handle missing data and outliers
- Cross-validation important for generalization
</REASONING>

<ACTION>
Let me start by outlining the data requirements:
- Historical sale prices
- Property characteristics
- Location data
...
</ACTION>

<FINAL_ANSWER>
Here's a complete plan for your ML model...
</FINAL_ANSWER>
```

### Planning Tags

PlanReActPlanner uses XML-like tags to structure reasoning:

| Tag | Purpose | When Used |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| `<PLANNING>` | Initial plan | Start of task |
| `<REASONING>` | Explain logic | Throughout process |
| `<ACTION>` | Execute steps | When doing something |
| `<OBSERVATION>` | Note results | After actions |
| `<REPLANNING>` | Adjust plan | When strategy changes |
| `<FINAL_ANSWER>` | Conclusion | End of task |

### Replanning Example

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.planners import PlanReActPlanner
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool
from google.adk.runners import Runner

# Tool that simulates failure
def check_api_status(api_name: str) -> str:
    """Check if API is available."""
    if api_name == "primary_api":
        return "ERROR: API unavailable"
    return "OK: API available"

# Agent with replanning capability
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='adaptive_agent',
    instruction='Use tools and adapt plan when issues arise.',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    tools=[FunctionTool(check_api_status)]
)

runner = Runner()
result = runner.run(
    "Fetch data from primary_api and process it",
    agent=agent
)

print(result.content.parts[0].text)
```

**Output shows replanning**:
```
<PLANNING>
Plan:
1. Check primary_api status
2. Fetch data from primary_api
3. Process data
</PLANNING>

<ACTION>
Checking primary_api status...
</ACTION>

<OBSERVATION>
API returned ERROR: API unavailable
</OBSERVATION>

<REPLANNING>
Primary API is down. New plan:
1. Check backup_api status
2. Use backup_api instead
3. Process data from backup source
</REPLANNING>

<ACTION>
Switching to backup_api...
</ACTION>

<FINAL_ANSWER>
Successfully retrieved and processed data using backup_api.
</FINAL_ANSWER>
```

### Planning Instructions

PlanReActPlanner injects detailed planning instructions:

```python
# Internal planning instruction (simplified)
PLANNING_INSTRUCTION = """
You must follow this structured reasoning format:

<PLANNING>
Break down the problem into steps:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. ...
</PLANNING>

<REASONING>
Explain why this plan makes sense:
- Consideration 1
- Consideration 2
</REASONING>

<ACTION>
Describe what you're doing now
</ACTION>

<OBSERVATION>
Note what happened
</OBSERVATION>

If plan needs adjustment:
<REPLANNING>
Explain why replanning and new plan:
1. New step 1
2. ...
</REPLANNING>

When done:
<FINAL_ANSWER>
Provide final result
</FINAL_ANSWER>
"""
```

## 4. BasePlanner (Custom Planners)

### What is BasePlanner?

`BasePlanner` is the **abstract base class** for creating custom planning strategies.

**Source**: `google/adk/planners/base_planner.py`

### Creating Custom Planner

```python
from google.adk.planners import BasePlanner
from google.adk.types import LlmRequest, LlmResponse

class MyCustomPlanner(BasePlanner):
    """Custom planning strategy."""
    
    def build_planning_instruction(self, agent, context) -> str:
        """Inject custom planning instructions."""
        return """
You are a systematic problem solver. For each task:

STEP 1: ANALYZE
- What's the goal?
- What constraints exist?
- What resources are available?

STEP 2: STRATEGIZE
- What are possible approaches?
- What are pros/cons of each?
- Which is optimal?

STEP 3: EXECUTE
- Implement chosen strategy
- Monitor progress
- Adjust as needed

STEP 4: VALIDATE
- Did we achieve the goal?
- What could be improved?
        """
    
    def process_planning_response(self, response: LlmResponse) -> LlmResponse:
        """Process response after planning."""
        # Could modify response here
        # Add metadata, validate structure, etc.
        return response

# Use custom planner
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=MyCustomPlanner()
)
```

### Advanced Custom Planner Example

```python
class DataSciencePlanner(BasePlanner):
    """Planner for data science workflows."""
    
    def build_planning_instruction(self, agent, context) -> str:
        return """
Follow the data science methodology:

<DATA_UNDERSTANDING>
1. What data is available?
2. What's the data quality?
3. What are the features?
</DATA_UNDERSTANDING>

<PROBLEM_FORMULATION>
1. What's the prediction target?
2. What type of problem? (classification, regression, clustering)
3. What's the success metric?
</PROBLEM_FORMULATION>

<MODELING_APPROACH>
1. Which algorithms are suitable?
2. How to validate? (train/test split, cross-validation)
3. How to tune hyperparameters?
</MODELING_APPROACH>

<EVALUATION>
1. What's the model performance?
2. Is it good enough?
3. How to improve?
</EVALUATION>

<DEPLOYMENT>
1. How to deploy model?
2. How to monitor performance?
3. How to update model?
</DEPLOYMENT>
        """

# Data science agent with custom planner
ds_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='data_scientist',
    planner=DataSciencePlanner(),
    instruction='You are an expert data scientist following best practices.'
)
```

## 5. Comparing Planners

### When to Use Each Planner

| Planner | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **BuiltInPlanner** | Complex reasoning tasks | Native thinking, transparent, fast | Gemini 2.0+ only |
| **PlanReActPlanner** | Multi-step workflows | Structured, replannable, debuggable | More verbose |
| **BasePlanner (Custom)** | Domain-specific logic | Full control, tailored | More implementation work |
| **No Planner** | Simple queries | Fast, minimal overhead | No structured reasoning |

### Decision Tree

```
Need planning?
‚îú‚îÄ No ‚Üí Use default (no planner)
‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí What type?
    ‚îú‚îÄ Want native model thinking?
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí BuiltInPlanner (Gemini 2.0+)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Need structured steps?
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí PlanReActPlanner
    ‚îú‚îÄ Domain-specific workflow?
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Custom BasePlanner
    ‚îî‚îÄ General purpose?
        ‚îî‚îÄ PlanReActPlanner (most flexible)
```

### Performance Comparison

```python
import asyncio
import time
from google.adk.agents import Agent, Runner
from google.adk.planners import BuiltInPlanner, PlanReActPlanner
from google.genai import types

async def compare_planners():
    """Compare planner performance."""
    
    query = "Design a sustainable urban transportation system"
    
    # No planner
    agent_default = Agent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='default'
    )
    
    # BuiltInPlanner
    agent_builtin = Agent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='builtin',
        planner=BuiltInPlanner(
            thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(include_thoughts=True)
        )
    )
    
    # PlanReActPlanner
    agent_planreact = Agent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='planreact',
        planner=PlanReActPlanner()
    )
    
    runner = Runner()
    
    for agent in [agent_default, agent_builtin, agent_planreact]:
        start = time.time()
        result = await runner.run_async(query, agent=agent)
        elapsed = time.time() - start
        
        print(f"\n{'='*60}")
        print(f"Agent: {agent.name}")
        print(f"Time: {elapsed:.2f}s")
        print(f"Response length: {len(result.content.parts[0].text)} chars")
        print(f"{'='*60}")

asyncio.run(compare_planners())
```

**Typical Results**:
- **No Planner**: 2-3s, 500-800 chars (direct answer)
- **BuiltInPlanner**: 4-6s, 800-1200 chars (with thinking)
- **PlanReActPlanner**: 5-8s, 1200-2000 chars (structured)

## 6. Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO: Match Planner to Task Complexity

```python
# ‚úÖ Simple query - no planner needed
simple_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    instruction='Answer questions concisely'
)
runner.run("What's 2+2?", agent=simple_agent)

# ‚úÖ Complex problem - use planner
complex_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    instruction='Solve complex problems systematically',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner()
)
runner.run("Design a climate change mitigation strategy", agent=complex_agent)
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Use include_thoughts Appropriately

```python
# ‚úÖ Educational/debugging - show thinking
educational_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=BuiltInPlanner(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(include_thoughts=True)
    )
)

# ‚úÖ Production - hide thinking
production_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=BuiltInPlanner(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(include_thoughts=False)
    )
)
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Provide Clear Instructions with Planners

```python
# ‚úÖ Good - Clear guidance
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    instruction="""
You are a systematic problem solver.

When using tools:
1. Plan which tools to use and in what order
2. Explain your reasoning
3. Execute the plan
4. Review results
5. Adjust plan if needed

Be thorough but concise.
    """
)

# ‚ùå Bad - Vague
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    instruction="Solve problems"
)
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Test Planner Overhead

```python
# ‚úÖ Measure impact
import time

# Without planner
start = time.time()
result1 = runner.run(query, agent=agent_no_planner)
time1 = time.time() - start

# With planner
start = time.time()
result2 = runner.run(query, agent=agent_with_planner)
time2 = time.time() - start

overhead = ((time2 - time1) / time1) * 100
print(f"Planner overhead: {overhead:.1f}%")

# Accept overhead if quality improves significantly
```

### ‚úÖ DO: Handle Planning Failures

```python
# ‚úÖ Graceful fallback
agent_with_fallback = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    instruction="""
Follow the planning format, but if you get stuck:
1. Acknowledge the difficulty
2. Provide best-effort answer
3. Explain limitations

Don't abandon the task completely.
    """

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Thinking not appearing in response"

**Problem**: Using BuiltInPlanner but no thinking shown

**Solutions**:

```python
# ‚ùå Problem - include_thoughts=False (default)
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=BuiltInPlanner()  # Defaults to include_thoughts=False
)

# ‚úÖ Solution - Explicitly set to True
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=BuiltInPlanner(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(include_thoughts=True)
    )
)

# Check model supports thinking
# Not all Gemini 2.0 models have thinking capability
```

### Issue: "Plan-ReAct tags not appearing"

**Problem**: Response doesn't follow structured format

**Solutions**:

```python
# 1. Emphasize format in instruction
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    instruction="""
IMPORTANT: You MUST use the structured format with tags:
<PLANNING>, <REASONING>, <ACTION>, <FINAL_ANSWER>

Do not deviate from this format.
    """
)

# 2. Increase temperature for creativity in planning
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        temperature=0.7  # Higher for creative planning
    )
)
```

### Issue: "Planner adds too much latency"

**Problem**: Responses too slow with planner

**Solutions**:

```python
# 1. Reduce max_output_tokens
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        max_output_tokens=1024  # Lower limit
    )
)

# 2. Use streaming for better UX
from google.adk.agents import RunConfig, StreamingMode

run_config = RunConfig(streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE)
async for event in runner.run_async(query, agent=agent, run_config=run_config):
    print(event.content.parts[0].text, end='', flush=True)

# 3. Use planner only for complex queries
def needs_planning(query: str) -> bool:
    complex_keywords = ['design', 'plan', 'strategy', 'analyze', 'compare']
    return any(kw in query.lower() for kw in complex_keywords)

agent = agent_with_planner if needs_planning(query) else agent_without_planner
```

### Issue: "Replanning not triggered"

**Problem**: Agent doesn't adjust plan when encountering issues

**Solutions**:

```python
# 1. Explicit replanning instruction
agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    instruction="""
When you encounter errors or unexpected results:
1. Use <OBSERVATION> to note what went wrong
2. Use <REPLANNING> to create new plan
3. Explain why replanning is needed

NEVER give up - always adapt your approach.
    """
)

# 2. Tool that forces replanning
def check_and_report(condition: bool, error_msg: str) -> str:
    if not condition:
        return f"ERROR: {error_msg}. Replanning needed."
    return "SUCCESS"

agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
    tools=[FunctionTool(check_and_report)]
)
```
