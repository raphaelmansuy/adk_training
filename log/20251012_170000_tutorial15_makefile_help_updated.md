# Tutorial 15: Makefile Help Menu Updated

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Missing `@echo` Command

**Issue**: Line 32 was missing `@echo`, causing the help output to stop at "DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS"

**Fixed**:
```makefile
# Before (BROKEN)
	@echo ""
🎪 DEMO COMMANDS:"

# After (FIXED)
	@echo ""
	@echo "🎪 DEMO COMMANDS:"
```

### 2. Added New "DIAGNOSTICS & SETUP" Section

Added missing diagnostic commands to the help menu:

```makefile
🔧 DIAGNOSTICS & SETUP:
  make live_env_check    # Verify Vertex AI Live API configuration
  make live_models_list  # List available Live API models in your project
  make check_audio       # Check audio device availability
  make live_smoke        # Quick Vertex Live connectivity smoke test
  make live_models_doc   # Show docs for supported Live API models
  make live_access_help  # Steps to request Gemini Live API activation
```

## Complete Help Output
