# Tutorial 29 - Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS Plugin Fix

**Date**: 2025-01-13 19:05:00  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Issue**: Vite PostCSS error after Tailwind CSS installation

## Problem

After installing Tailwind CSS v3 dependencies, Vite threw an error:

```
[postcss] It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS 
with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

## Root Cause

Tailwind CSS v4 changed its architecture:
- **Old approach**: Use `tailwindcss` package directly as PostCSS plugin
- **New approach**: Use separate `@tailwindcss/postcss` package for PostCSS integration

Our `postcss.config.js` was using the old format:
```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},  // ❌ No longer works in v4
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

## Solution

### 1. Install New Package

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
```

**Result**: Added 19 packages, total 213 packages

### 2. Update PostCSS Config

```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},  // ✅ New v4 plugin
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

## Files Modified

- `frontend/package.json`: Added `@tailwindcss/postcss` to devDependencies
- `frontend/postcss.config.js`: Changed plugin from `tailwindcss` to `@tailwindcss/postcss`

## Verification

✅ Vite server reloaded successfully  
✅ PostCSS pipeline compiling without errors  
✅ Frontend accessible at http://localhost:5173  
✅ Backend running at http://localhost:8000

## Next Steps

User should test the chat interface:
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Send a test message
3. Verify Tailwind styles render correctly
4. Check streaming functionality still works

## Technical Notes

This is consistent with Tutorial 30's approach, which uses Tailwind CSS v4 alpha with the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin architecture.
