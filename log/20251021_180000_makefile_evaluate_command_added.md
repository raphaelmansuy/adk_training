# 20251021_180000_makefile_evaluate_command_added.md

## Summary
Added comprehensive `make evaluate` command and demonstration script for RUBRIC_BASED_TOOL_USE_QUALITY_V1 metric.

## What Was Added

### 1. New File: `evaluate_tool_use.py`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate how to use the RUBRIC_BASED_TOOL_USE_QUALITY_V1 evaluation metric
- **Content**: 
  - Example 1: Tool sequencing evaluation configuration structure
  - Example 2: How to define tool use quality rubrics
  - Example 3: Good vs bad tool sequencing comparison
  - Example 4: How LLM judge evaluates tool usage
  - Example 5: Interpreting evaluation scores
  - Example 6: When to use the metric
  - Example 7: Complete evaluation workflow
  - Example 8: Combining with other metrics

### 2. Updated Makefile
- Added `.PHONY: evaluate` declaration
- Added `evaluate` target to help message
- Added `make evaluate` command that runs `python evaluate_tool_use.py`
- Output shows: "ðŸ“Š Demonstrating LlmAsJudge with RUBRIC_BASED_TOOL_USE_QUALITY_V1"

## Key Learning Point

The RUBRIC_BASED_TOOL_USE_QUALITY_V1 metric works differently than initially thought:
- **NOT** `LlmAsJudge` class (that doesn't exist in current ADK version)
- **Uses** `RubricsBasedCriterion` in `EvalConfig` 
- **Configured** via evaluation configuration dictionaries
- **Evaluates** tool sequences against user-defined rubrics

The evaluation demo now correctly shows:
1. How to structure the evaluation config with rubrics
2. Examples of good vs bad tool sequencing
3. How LLM judge evaluates tool calls
4. Score interpretation and thresholds
5. Complete workflow for evaluation

## Testing
- âœ… All 23 existing tests still pass
- âœ… `make evaluate` command works correctly
- âœ… Script runs without errors
- âœ… Output displays properly with all 8 examples

## Usage

Run the new evaluation demo:
```bash
cd til_implementation/til_rubric_based_tool_use_quality_20251021
make evaluate
```

Or directly:
```bash
python evaluate_tool_use.py
```
