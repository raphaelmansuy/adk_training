  - **Level 2**: Add Error Handling (100 lines) - Intermediate
  - **Level 3**: Add Analysis Tools (400 lines) - Advanced

### 🟠 Major Issues: FIXED (5/5)

#### Issue 4: ✅ Inconsistent Code Block Language Specifications
- **Verified**: All code blocks have proper language specs
- **Examples**: `python`, `bash`, `text`, `dockerfile`
- **Impact**: Proper syntax highlighting throughout

#### Issue 5: ✅ Disorganized Header Hierarchy
- **Problem**: Mixed use of **bold text** and proper markdown headers
- **Fixed**: Converted 15+ incorrect headers to proper ### hierarchy
- **Examples Fixed**:
  - "**1. User uploads CSV file**" → "#### 1. User uploads CSV file"
  - "**Step 1: Prepare Repository**" → "#### Step 1: Prepare Repository"
  - "**Issue 1: Please set GOOGLE_API_KEY**" → "#### Issue 1: Please set GOOGLE_API_KEY"

#### Issue 6: ✅ Progressive Complexity Too Steep
- **Problem**: Jumped from 50-line to 350-line examples
- **Fix**: Added intermediate 100-line example with step-by-step improvements
- **Result**: 
  - Minimal Example (50 lines) ✓
  - Better Example (100 lines) ✓
  - Full Featured (400 lines) ✓

#### Issue 7: ✅ Incomplete Code Examples
- **Problem**: Some examples used undefined types (Content, Part)
- **Fix**: Added missing imports and documented all types
- **Result**: All code is now runnable

#### Issue 8: ✅ Poor Feature Section Organization
- **Problem**: Features 1 & 2 were embedded together, hard to distinguish
- **Fix**: Created clear separate sections with dividers
- **Result**:
  - Feature 1: Interactive Visualizations (clear, concise)
  - Feature 2: Multi-dataset support
  - Feature 3: Export functionality

## 🎯 Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Progressive Learning Path**

**Before**: Feature code → Minimal code → Advanced code (disorganized)

**After**: 
```
Start Here (50 lines)
     ↓
Add Error Handling (100 lines)
     ↓
Add Analysis Tools (400 lines)
     ↓
Advanced Features (visualizations, export, etc.)
```

Each level is independent and can be studied separately.

### 2. **Proper Documentation Hierarchy**

**Fixed 15+ instances** of incorrect formatting:
- Bold text pretending to be headers → Proper markdown headers
- Unclear numbering → Clear hierarchical structure
- Inconsistent spacing → Proper blank lines

### 3. **Removed Duplicate Content**

- Deleted 100 lines of redundant code
- Eliminated confusion from duplicated explanations
- Cleaner, more maintainable documentation

### 4. **Added Intermediate Complexity**

**New Level 2 Example** shows:
- Better error handling patterns
- Improved context preparation
- File upload in sidebar
- Status containers for progress
- Memory usage info

### 5. **Better Section Organization**

Before:
```
Building a Data Analysis App
├── Feature 1: Tool-Augmented Analysis (with embedded Feature 2 code)
└── Feature 2: Interactive Visualizations (scattered throughout Feature 1)
```

After:
```
Building Your App - Progressive Examples
├── Level 1: Basic Chat (50 lines)
├── Level 2: Add Error Handling (100 lines)
└── Level 3: Add Analysis Tools (400 lines)

Building a Data Analysis App
├── Feature 1: Interactive Visualizations
├── Feature 2: Multi-Dataset Support
└── Feature 3: Export Analysis Results
```

## ✨ What Still Looks Great (Preserved)

✅ Excellent "Why This Matters" introduction  
✅ Clear ASCII tech stack diagram  
✅ Great "Key Concepts" section  
✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting guide  
✅ Multiple deployment options documented  
✅ Professional tone and language  
✅ Good use of emojis for scanning  
✅ Practical "Try It" examples  

---

## 📝 Remaining Minor Issues (Cosmetic - Non-Blocking)

### Line Length Warnings (25 instances)
- **Type**: Some lines exceed 80 characters
- **Severity**: NONE - Code still renders perfectly
- **Examples**: Long function signatures, long descriptions
- **Decision**: Keep as-is - readability over arbitrary 80-char limit

### List Spacing (5 instances)
- **Type**: Some lists missing blank lines
- **Severity**: NONE - Renders correctly
- **Decision**: Keep as-is - content is clear

### Multiple H1 Headers (1 instance)
- **Type**: Document has multiple top-level headers
- **Severity**: NONE - Common in tutorials
- **Decision**: Keep as-is - tutorial structure requires this
