✅ Internal tools for data scientists
[...]

❌ Complex multi-page web apps
❌ High customization needs
```

**Problems**:
- Info-heavy opening
- Assumes you know ADK already
- Features before benefits

---

### AFTER: Why First, Then How

```markdown
# Tutorial 32: Streamlit + ADK - Build Data Analysis Apps in Pure Python

**Time**: 45 minutes | **Level**: Intermediate | **Language**: Python only

---

## Why This Matters

Building data apps shouldn't require learning JavaScript, React, or 
managing separate frontend/backend services.

### The Problem You're Solving

```
Without this: Learn React, TypeScript, manage backend, deploy 2 services
With this: Pure Python, one file, deploy in 2 minutes
```

### What You'll Build

A **data analysis chatbot** that:
- Accepts CSV file uploads
- Chats with your data naturally
- Generates charts with matplotlib/plotly
- Deploys to the cloud with one command
