# Tutorial 21: Uploaded Image Support Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-01-13 17:55:39
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Test Results**: 66 tests passing (was 63), 74% coverage

## Problem

User identified limitation: "Why not taking into account uploaded images?"

The agent only supported file-based image processing, requiring users to:
1. Save images to disk
2. Provide file paths in queries
3. Manually manage image files

This created friction for the primary use case: drag-and-drop images in ADK web UI.

## Solution

Added `analyze_uploaded_image()` tool for direct image analysis from web UI uploads.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **No File Path Required**: Gemini vision models can see images directly in query content
2. **Tool Signature**: `analyze_uploaded_image(product_name: str, tool_context: ToolContext)`
3. **Same Workflow**: Uses existing vision_analyzer ‚Üí catalog_generator pipeline
4. **Root Agent Logic**: Updated instruction to prioritize uploaded images over file paths

### Code Changes

**vision_catalog_agent/agent.py** (543 lines):
- Added `analyze_uploaded_image()` function (80+ lines)
- Updated root_agent from 2 tools ‚Üí 3 tools
- Enhanced instruction with decision logic for upload vs file path scenarios

**tests/test_agent.py** (25 tests, was 24):
- Added `test_analyze_uploaded_image_callable()`
- Updated tool count expectations: `assert len(root_agent.tools) >= 3`
- Updated tool name validation to include 'analyze_uploaded_image'

**tests/test_multimodal.py** (21 tests, was 19):
- Added `TestAnalyzeUploadedImage` class (2 tests)
- Test success scenario with mocked sub-agent execution
- Test error handling when vision analysis fails

**tests/test_imports.py**:
- Added import validation for `analyze_uploaded_image`

## Documentation Updates

**README.md**:
- Added "Using Uploaded Images (Recommended)" section
- Reorganized examples to prioritize web UI uploads
- Fixed 13 markdown lint errors (blank lines, code fences)

**demo.py**:
- Added header note about web UI for uploaded images
- Updated main demo to show web UI instructions first
- Emphasized file-based processing is alternative method

**Makefile**:
- Enhanced demo target with "üéØ RECOMMENDED: Upload Images Directly"
- Added web UI workflow steps
- Reorganized to show upload method before file-based examples

## Test Results

```bash
pytest tests/ --tb=short -q
# 66 passed in 4.58s
# Coverage: 74% (was 73%)
```

### Test Breakdown
- test_agent.py: 25 tests (configuration, tools, signatures)
- test_imports.py: 7 tests (import validation)
- test_multimodal.py: 21 tests (image processing, uploaded images)
- test_structure.py: 15 tests (project structure)

## User Impact

**Before**:
```
User: [uploads image]
User: "Analyze this image at /path/to/saved/image.jpg"
‚ùå Required manual file management
```

**After**:
```
User: [uploads image]
User: "Analyze this product and create a catalog entry"
‚úÖ Direct analysis without file paths
```

## Technical Notes

### Why This Works
- Gemini vision models receive query content as multimodal input
- Images uploaded via web UI are automatically included in query
- No explicit image loading needed - model "sees" images directly
- Sub-agent execution (tool_context.run_agent) passes images through

### API Compatibility
- Compatible with google-genai v1.15.0+
- Uses same types.Part API for multimodal content
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `vision_catalog_agent/agent.py` - Core implementation
2. `tests/test_agent.py` - Agent tests
3. `tests/test_multimodal.py` - Multimodal tests
4. `tests/test_imports.py` - Import validation
5. `README.md` - User documentation
6. `demo.py` - Demo script
7. `Makefile` - Demo prompts

## Verification Steps

- [x] All 66 tests passing
- [x] Coverage at 74%
- [x] No lint errors in updated files
- [x] README markdown validation passed
- [x] Documentation reflects new capability
- [x] Tool signatures validated
- [x] Import tests updated

## Next Steps

Ready for user testing in ADK web interface:
1. Run `adk web`
2. Select `vision_catalog_agent`
3. Upload image via drag-and-drop
4. Verify `analyze_uploaded_image` tool is invoked
5. Confirm catalog entry generation works

## Summary

Enhanced Tutorial 21 to support uploaded images from ADK web UI. Users can now drag-and-drop images directly into the chat interface without managing file paths. Implementation adds 1 new tool, 3 new tests, and comprehensive documentation updates. All 66 tests passing with 74% coverage.
