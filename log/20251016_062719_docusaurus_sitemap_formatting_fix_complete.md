# 20251016_062719_docusaurus_sitemap_formatting_fix_complete

## Summary
Fixed Docusaurus sitemap.xml formatting issue that was causing Google Search Console to report 'Couldn't fetch' errors.

## Problem
- Docusaurus was generating minified sitemap.xml (single line)
- Google Search Console couldn't parse the minified XML
- This happened on every build

## Solution
- Created a custom Docusaurus plugin using the postBuild lifecycle hook
- Plugin automatically formats sitemap.xml with proper indentation after each build
- Added @xmldom/xmldom dependency for XML parsing
- Plugin runs automatically on every build, ensuring consistent formatting

## Files Modified
- docs/docusaurus.config.ts: Added custom sitemap-formatter plugin
- docs/package.json: Added @xmldom/xmldom dependency

## Testing
- Build completes successfully
- sitemap.xml is properly formatted with indentation
- Google Search Console should now be able to read the sitemap

## Next Steps
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Re-submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- Monitor indexing status
