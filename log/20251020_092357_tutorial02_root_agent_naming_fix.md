# Tutorial 02 - Function Tools Documentation Fix

## Issue

Tutorial 02 documentation contained an inconsistency in the "Real-World Example:
Multi-City Financial Planning" section. The example agent was named
`parallel_finance_agent` instead of following the ADK naming convention of
`root_agent`.

This caused errors when users tried to run the agent because the ADK framework
expects agents to be exported as `root_agent` to be discoverable.

## Resolution

Changed the variable name in the example code from `parallel_finance_agent` to
`root_agent` to maintain consistency with:

- ADK's agent discovery requirements
- ADK training project guidelines (documented in copilot-instructions.md)
- Other tutorial examples (Tutorial 01, Tutorial 02 main example, etc.)

## Files Modified

- `docs/docs/02_function_tools.md` - Line 668 (Real-World Example section)

## What Changed

```python
# BEFORE:
parallel_finance_agent = Agent(
    name="parallel_finance_assistant",
    ...
)

# AFTER:
root_agent = Agent(
    name="parallel_finance_assistant",
    ...
)
```

## Impact

- Users following the tutorial can now successfully run the parallel execution
  example
- The agent is now discoverable by the ADK web interface
- Documentation is consistent with project guidelines and other tutorials

## Status

âœ… Complete - Documentation updated and verified
