- Platform 1: Local Development ($0, free)
- Platform 2: Cloud Run ($40-50/mo, realistic calculations)
- Platform 3: Agent Engine ($527/mo, model-based pricing)
- Platform 4: GKE ($372-260/mo with discounts, complex)
- Comprehensive cost comparison tables (1M and 10M requests)
- Decision framework by budget tier
- ROI analysis (infrastructure is typically <1% of total cost)
- Hidden costs (development, monitoring, support)
- Cost reduction strategies (Tier 1, 2, 3 approaches)
- Comparisons to alternatives (AWS Lambda, Heroku)
- Cost monitoring setup

**Impact**: Users can make informed budget decisions and understand total cost of ownership.
