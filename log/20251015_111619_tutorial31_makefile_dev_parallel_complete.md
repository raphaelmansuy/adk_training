# Tutorial 31 Makefile Improvement - Dev Parallel Launch Complete

## Summary

Enhanced the Makefile for Tutorial 31 (Data Analysis Dashboard) to include
a `dev-parallel` target that launches both the ADK agent backend and React
frontend simultaneously with proper process management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `dev` Target

- **Before**: Printed instructions requiring 2 separate terminals
- **After**: Actually launches both services in parallel using `make dev-parallel`

### 2. Added `dev-parallel` Target

- Uses `trap 'kill 0' EXIT` to ensure both processes are killed when Ctrl+C is pressed
- Runs agent backend: `(cd agent && . venv/bin/activate && python agent.py) &`
- Runs frontend: `(cd frontend && npm run dev) &`
- Uses `wait` to keep the parent process alive until children exit

### 3. Updated Help Documentation

- Changed `make dev` description from "requires 2 terminals" to
  "Run both agent and frontend simultaneously"
- Simplified the "Full Workflow" section to show the streamlined process

## Benefits

- **Simplified Development**: Single command `make dev` now starts the entire application
- **Better UX**: No need to manage multiple terminals manually
- **Proper Cleanup**: Ctrl+C kills both processes cleanly
- **Consistent with Tutorial 30**: Follows the same pattern
  used in the previous tutorial

## Testing

- Verified Makefile syntax with `make -n dev-parallel`
- Confirmed help output displays correctly
- Process management follows proven pattern from Tutorial 30

## Usage

```bash
make setup    # Install dependencies
make dev      # Start both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 5173)
# Ctrl+C to stop both services
```

The improvement maintains backward compatibility - individual `make dev-agent`
and `make dev-frontend` commands still work for development scenarios requiring
separate terminals.
