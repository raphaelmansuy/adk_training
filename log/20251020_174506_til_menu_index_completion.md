# TIL Menu and Index Update - Complete

## Issue
The menu and index didn't take into account all TIL articles. Specifically, the "Pause and Resume Invocations" TIL article (October 20, 2025) was missing from the index file while it was already in the sidebar.

## Root Cause Analysis
- `til_pause_resume_20251020.md` was created and properly added to `sidebars.ts`
- However, `TIL_INDEX.md` only documented the "Context Compaction" TIL
- The index page was incomplete, missing the Pause & Resume section

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/docs/docs/til/TIL_INDEX.md`
- **Added**: Complete "Pause and Resume Invocations (October 20, 2025)" section to the "Available TILs" area
- **Content includes**:
  - Link to the full TIL document
  - Description of the feature
  - Key points with emojis
  - Learning outcomes
  - Metadata (ADK Version, Complexity, Time)
- **Formatting fixes**: Applied proper markdown formatting for lists and line lengths throughout the file

### 2. Verified Sidebar Configuration
- ✅ `sidebars.ts` already includes both TILs:
  - `til/til_context_compaction_20250119`
  - `til/til_pause_resume_20251020`
- ✅ Template file correctly referenced
- ✅ Index page correctly referenced

### 3. Verified File Structure
- ✅ All TIL files exist:
  - `TIL_INDEX.md` (index)
  - `TIL_TEMPLATE.md` (template)
  - `til_context_compaction_20250119.md` (article)
  - `til_pause_resume_20251020.md` (article)
- ✅ All frontmatter IDs match sidebar references

## Files Changed
- `/docs/docs/til/TIL_INDEX.md` - Added Pause & Resume section and formatting fixes

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All TIL articles are now properly documented in both the menu and index

## Verification
- Index file now documents 2 published TILs (Context Compaction and Pause & Resume)
- Sidebar already contains correct references to both TILs
- All file IDs and paths are consistent
- Markdown formatting improved for consistency
