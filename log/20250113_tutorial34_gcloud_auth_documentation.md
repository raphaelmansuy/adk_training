## What Was Added

Added comprehensive authentication section to README to help users set up gcloud and GCP projects.

## Documentation Sections

### Section 0: Prerequisites: gcloud CLI Setup (NEW)

Added 5 subsections with complete setup instructions:

- **A. Install gcloud CLI** - macOS Homebrew and direct download links
- **B. Authenticate with Google Cloud** - `gcloud auth login` with browser flow
- **C. Set Default Project** - Project listing and configuration
- **D. Configure Application Default Credentials** - Local development setup
- **E. Verify Your Setup** - Configuration verification

### Troubleshooting: 5 New Authentication Issues (NEW)

1. "gcloud command not found" - Installation instructions
2. "ERROR: (gcloud.pubsub.topics.create) User does not have permission" - Auth/project issues
3. "ERROR: (gcloud.config.set) Unable to find project" - Wrong project ID
4. Application Credentials Error - Local development setup
5. "PERMISSION_DENIED: User does not have permission to access topic" - IAM roles
