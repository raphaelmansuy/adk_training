# Tutorial 17: Agent-to-Agent Documentation Sync Complete

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Time**: 15:30  
**Task**: Update docs/tutorial/17_agent_to_agent.md to sync with implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Introduction and Overview
- Replaced `RemoteA2aAgent` references with real A2A SDK implementation
- Updated goal to mention "real Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol SDK"
- Added emphasis on A2A SDK and `A2AClient` usage

### 2. Fixed Agent Discovery Section
- Updated agent card path from hypothetical examples to actual `.well-known/agent.json`
- Updated example agent cards to match localhost:9001-9003 setup
- Removed outdated ADK imports and focused on A2A SDK

### 3. Updated Code Examples
- Replaced all `RemoteA2aAgent` examples with `A2ARemoteAgent` wrapper
- Added proper A2A SDK imports (`a2a.client`, `a2a.types`)
- Included real message request structure with UUID generation
- Added proper response parsing for nested A2A response structure

### 4. Updated Architecture Section
- Changed port numbers from 8001-8003 to 9001-9003
- Updated architecture diagram to show A2A SDK flow
- Referenced actual A2A SDK components instead of hypothetical ADK wrappers

### 5. Added Real Implementation Examples
- Included complete working code from `a2a_orchestrator/agent.py`
- Added `A2ARemoteAgent` wrapper class implementation
- Showed proper error handling and response extraction
- Added tool functions for each remote agent type

### 6. Updated Quick Start Section
- Added proper Makefile commands (`make start-agents`, `make check-agents`)
- Included process management script usage
- Added A2A communication testing steps
- Replaced hypothetical examples with real localhost setup

### 7. Updated Authentication Section
- Reflected A2A SDK authentication patterns
- Showed agent cards without authentication for local development
- Removed outdated ADK credential storage examples
- Added production authentication examples

### 8. Updated Advanced Patterns
- Replaced ADK-specific patterns with A2A SDK patterns
- Added error handling and retry patterns using tenacity
- Included parallel execution with asyncio.gather
- Added agent health monitoring with httpx

### 9. Added Implementation Structure Section
- Documented actual project structure from tutorial17/
- Included real A2A server implementation using `AgentExecutor`
- Added process management script examples
- Explained A2A SDK server patterns

### 10. Updated Troubleshooting
- Added real troubleshooting based on implementation experience
- Included port conflict resolution steps
- Added A2A response parsing debugging
- Provided actual Makefile commands for debugging

## Key Technical Changes

### Before (Hypothetical)
- Used non-existent `RemoteA2aAgent` from ADK
- Referenced external services on example.com
- Showed theoretical authentication flows
- Included complex deployment scenarios

### After (Real Implementation)
- Uses actual A2A SDK with `A2AClient` and `A2ACardResolver`
- Localhost agents on ports 9001-9003
- Real process management with scripts
- Working code that matches tutorial17/ implementation

## File Structure Alignment

The tutorial now accurately reflects:
- `a2a_orchestrator/agent.py` - Main orchestrator implementation
- `research_agent/agent_executor.py` - A2A server pattern
- `start_agents.sh` / `stop_agents.sh` - Process management
- `Makefile` - Development commands
- `test_a2a_communication.py` - Testing approach

## Validation

- All code examples match actual implementation
- Port numbers updated to 9001-9003
- Make commands align with actual Makefile
- Process management reflects real scripts
- Troubleshooting covers actual issues encountered

## Impact

- Tutorial now provides accurate guidance for A2A implementation
- Developers can follow tutorial and run actual working code
- No more confusion between hypothetical ADK wrappers and real A2A SDK
- Clear path from tutorial to production A2A deployment

**Status**: âœ… Complete - Tutorial 17 now accurately reflects the working implementation
