# Blog Article Link Fix - Complete

## Summary
Fixed the URL format for the "Deploy Your AI Agent in 5 Minutes" blog article by adding a slug field to its frontmatter.

## Problem
The blog article at `docs/blog/2025-10-17-deploy-ai-agents.md` was generating an inconsistent URL format:
- **Old URL**: `https://raphaelmansuy.github.io/adk_training/blog/2025/10/17/deploy-ai-agents/`
- **Issue**: Used date-based URL path (YYYY/MM/DD) instead of clean slug-based URL

Other blog posts use clean slug-based URLs:
- Example: `https://raphaelmansuy.github.io/adk_training/blog/multi-agent-pattern-complexity-management`

## Solution
Added `slug: deploy-ai-agents-5-minutes` to the frontmatter of `docs/blog/2025-10-17-deploy-ai-agents.md`

## Changes Made

**File**: `docs/blog/2025-10-17-deploy-ai-agents.md`

Added slug field to YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
slug: deploy-ai-agents-5-minutes
title: "Deploy Your AI Agent in 5 Minutes (Seriously)"
description: "..."
...
---
```

## Expected Result
After Docusaurus rebuild, the blog article URL will change to:
- **New URL**: `https://raphaelmansuy.github.io/adk_training/blog/deploy-ai-agents-5-minutes`

This matches the cleaner URL format used by other blog posts and is more SEO-friendly.

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Added `slug` field to blog post frontmatter
2. ✅ Slug follows naming convention: `deploy-ai-agents-5-minutes`
3. ✅ Consistent with other blog post slugs

## Notes
- The blog article itself is fully functional and accessible
- This change only affects the URL path, not the content
- Docusaurus will automatically regenerate the URL structure on next build
- Old URL may need redirect setup if external links reference it

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Blog article link fixed and ready for deployment
