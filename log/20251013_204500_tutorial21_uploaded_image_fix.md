# Tutorial 21: Fix for Uploaded Image Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-13 20:45:00
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Issue**: tool_context.run_agent() not available in web UI context

## Problem

User reported error when trying to analyze uploaded office chair image:
> "I encountered an error during the analysis of the uploaded image. The error
> message indicates that a required attribute (run_agent) is missing."

The `analyze_uploaded_image()` tool was trying to call `tool_context.run_agent()`
to execute sub-agents (vision_analyzer and catalog_generator), but this method
is not available in all execution contexts, particularly in the ADK web interface.

## Root Cause

The initial implementation assumed tool_context would always have a `run_agent()`
method to call sub-agents. However, in the web interface, tools execute in a
different context where this method may not be available.

## Solution

Redesigned `analyze_uploaded_image()` to work as a guidance tool rather than
executing sub-agents:

**Before** (Broken):
```python
# Tried to call sub-agents from within the tool
result = await tool_context.run_agent(vision_analyzer, instruction)
catalog_result = await tool_context.run_agent(catalog_generator, query)
```

**After** (Fixed):
```python
# Returns structured guidance for the root agent to follow
return {
    'status': 'success',
    'analysis_framework': {...},  # Structured analysis template
    'instruction_for_agent': "..."  # Clear instructions
}
```

### Key Design Changes

1. **Tool Returns Guidance**: Instead of executing analysis, the tool returns a
   structured framework for the root agent to follow

2. **Root Agent Does Analysis**: The root agent (which has vision capabilities)
   performs the actual image analysis following the framework

3. **No Sub-Agent Calls**: Eliminates dependency on `tool_context.run_agent()`

4. **Updated Instruction**: Root agent instruction now explains this workflow:
   - Call `analyze_uploaded_image(product_name)` first
   - Get back analysis_framework and instruction_for_agent
   - Agent then analyzes the image it can see
   - Provides comprehensive response to user

## Code Changes

### vision_catalog_agent/agent.py

**analyze_uploaded_image() function** (~70 lines):
- Removed `await tool_context.run_agent()` calls
- Returns structured analysis_framework with categories:
  - product_identification
  - visual_features
  - quality_indicators
  - distinctive_features
  - market_positioning
- Includes formatted instruction_for_agent with markdown catalog template

**root_agent.instruction** (~40 lines):
- Clarified workflow for uploaded images
- Emphasized that agent has vision capabilities
- Explained tool provides structure, agent does analysis
- Added key points about following the framework

### tests/test_multimodal.py

**TestAnalyzeUploadedImage class**:
- `test_analyze_uploaded_image_success`: Updated to verify guidance structure
- `test_analyze_uploaded_image_error_handling`: New test for error scenarios
- Removed mocking of run_agent since it's no longer used

## Benefits

1. **Works in Web UI**: No dependency on context-specific methods
2. **Simpler Architecture**: Tool provides guidance, agent analyzes
3. **Better UX**: Root agent can see uploaded images directly
4. **More Flexible**: Works across different execution contexts
5. **Cleaner Code**: Eliminates complex sub-agent orchestration from tools

## Test Results

```bash
66 passed in 4.61s
Coverage: 73% (was 74%)
```

All tests passing, including:
- ✅ analyze_uploaded_image returns correct structure
- ✅ analysis_framework includes all required categories
- ✅ instruction_for_agent is properly formatted
- ✅ Tool is callable from root agent
- ✅ Import validation passes

## User Impact

**Before (Broken)**:
```
User: [uploads office chair image] Product ID: PRD01
Agent: Calls analyze_uploaded_image tool
Tool: Tries to call tool_context.run_agent()
Error: "required attribute (run_agent) is missing"
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```
User: [uploads office chair image] Product ID: PRD01
Agent: Calls analyze_uploaded_image tool
Tool: Returns analysis_framework and instruction
Agent: Analyzes visible image following framework
Response: Comprehensive product catalog entry
```

## Verification Steps

To test the fix:

1. Start ADK web interface:
   ```bash
   cd tutorial_implementation/tutorial21
   make dev
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:8000

3. Select `vision_catalog_agent`

4. Upload an image (drag and drop or paste)

5. Provide product name: "PRD01" or any name

6. Agent should now successfully analyze the image

## Technical Notes

- Root agent has model='gemini-2.0-flash-exp' with vision capabilities
- Uploaded images are automatically visible to the agent in multimodal context
- Tool acts as a structured prompt generator rather than executor
- This pattern works better for web UI where execution context is constrained

## Files Modified

1. `vision_catalog_agent/agent.py` - Fixed analyze_uploaded_image function
2. `vision_catalog_agent/agent.py` - Updated root_agent instruction
3. `tests/test_multimodal.py` - Updated test expectations
4. `log/20251013_204500_tutorial21_uploaded_image_fix.md` - This log

## Lessons Learned

1. **Context Awareness**: Tools must work in various execution contexts
2. **Avoid Assumptions**: Don't assume tool_context methods are always available
3. **Guidance Pattern**: Tools can provide structure for agents to follow
4. **Vision Capabilities**: Root agents with vision can analyze images directly
5. **Test Coverage**: Tests should verify behavior in actual usage scenarios

## Next Steps

Users can now:
- Upload images directly in web UI ✅
- Get comprehensive product catalog analysis ✅
- No workarounds or file path requirements ✅
- Seamless multimodal experience ✅

The tutorial now works as intended for the primary use case: analyzing uploaded
product images in the ADK web interface.
