### A2A Protocol Governance

**File**: docs/blog/2025-10-21-gemini-enterprise.md (Line ~120)

**Change**: Added clarity that A2A is community-managed open standard

**Why**: Improves transparency. A2A is co-founded by Google but maintained by
a2aproject community, not a pure Google product like ADK.

**Before**:
"An open standard that enables agents..."

**After**:
"An open protocol (co-founded by Google but community-managed) that enables
agents...Unlike ADK and Agent Builder which are Google products, A2A is an
open standard under Apache 2.0 license managed by the open-source community."
