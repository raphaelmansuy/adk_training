# README.md Tutorial Completion Status Update

## Summary

Updated README.md to accurately reflect the current state of tutorial implementations. The project now shows 15 completed tutorials (44% completion) instead of the previously listed 12 tutorials (35%).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Completion Statistics
- Changed from 12/34 (35%) to 15/34 (44%) completed tutorials
- Updated draft tutorial count from 22 to 19

### 2. Updated Tutorial Status Markers
Marked the following tutorials as ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- Tutorial 13: Code Execution
- Tutorial 14: Streaming & SSE  
- Tutorial 17: Agent-to-Agent Communication

### 3. Updated Project Structure
Added three new tutorial implementations to the project structure tree:
- `tutorial13/` - Code Execution
- `tutorial14/` - Streaming & SSE
- `tutorial17/` - Agent-to-Agent Communication

### 4. Updated Tutorial Table
Changed status from üìù Draft to ‚úÖ Completed for tutorials 13, 14, and 17 in the main tutorial overview table.

### 5. Updated Learning Path Sections
- Removed "üìù DRAFT" designation from Advanced Features section header
- Updated tutorial status indicators in learning path

### 6. Added Advanced Features Section
Created new "Advanced Features" subsection in completed tutorials listing:
- Tutorial 13: Code Execution - Safe code execution environments and sandboxing
- Tutorial 14: Streaming & SSE - Real-time streaming responses with Server-Sent Events
- Tutorial 17: Agent-to-Agent Communication - Distributed multi-agent systems with A2A protocol

### 7. Updated Draft Tutorials Section
- Updated count from 22 to 19 draft tutorials
- Modified description to reflect tutorials 15-16, 18-28 as remaining drafts
- Removed mentions of code execution, streaming, and A2A communication as these are now complete

## Verification

All changes verified against actual tutorial_implementation directory:
```
tutorial01/ ‚úÖ
tutorial02/ ‚úÖ
tutorial03/ ‚úÖ
tutorial04/ ‚úÖ
tutorial05/ ‚úÖ
tutorial06/ ‚úÖ
tutorial07/ ‚úÖ
tutorial08/ ‚úÖ
tutorial09/ ‚úÖ
tutorial10/ ‚úÖ
tutorial11/ ‚úÖ
tutorial12/ ‚úÖ
tutorial13/ ‚úÖ (newly recognized)
tutorial14/ ‚úÖ (newly recognized)
tutorial17/ ‚úÖ (newly recognized)
```

Each implementation includes:
- pyproject.toml
- requirements.txt
- Makefile
- tests/ directory
- agent.py implementation

## Impact

- **Accuracy**: README now accurately reflects actual implementation status
- **Progress**: Shows real progress (44% vs 35% completion)
- **Transparency**: Users can see which tutorials have working code
- **Consistency**: All references to completion status are now synchronized

## Next Steps

None required. Documentation is now synchronized with implementation reality.
