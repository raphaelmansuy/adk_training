# Tutorial 16: Human-in-the-Loop & Security Enhancement - Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval workflow and restricted filesystem access for Tutorial 16 MCP agent following Google ADK best practices.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Callback

Implemented `before_tool_callback` to intercept and control tool execution:

```python
def before_tool_callback(
    callback_context: CallbackContext,
    tool_name: str,
    args: Dict[str, Any]
) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Human-in-the-Loop callback for MCP filesystem operations.
    Requires approval for destructive operations.
    """
    # Destructive operations list
    DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS = {
        'write_file': 'Writing files modifies content',
        'write_text_file': 'Writing files modifies content',
        'move_file': 'Moving files changes file locations',
        'create_directory': 'Creating directories modifies filesystem structure',
    }
    
    # Check and block if no approval
    if tool_name in DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS:
        auto_approve = callback_context.state.get('user:auto_approve_file_ops', False)
        if not auto_approve:
            return {
                'status': 'requires_approval',
                'message': 'APPROVAL REQUIRED - Operation blocked for safety'
            }
    
    return None  # Allow execution
```

### 2. Restricted Directory Access

**Security Enhancement**: MCP server now restricted to `sample_files/` directory only:

```python
def create_mcp_filesystem_agent(base_directory: str = None) -> Agent:
    if base_directory is None:
        # Default to sample_files for safety
        current_dir = os.getcwd()
        base_directory = os.path.join(current_dir, 'sample_files')
        
        # Create if doesn't exist
        if not os.path.exists(base_directory):
            os.makedirs(base_directory, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Convert to absolute path for security
    base_directory = os.path.abspath(base_directory)
    logger.info(f"[SECURITY] MCP filesystem access restricted to: {base_directory}")
```

### 3. Enhanced Agent Instructions

Updated agent instruction to explain HITL workflow to users:

- Clear explanation of scoped access
- List of safe vs destructive operations
- Approval workflow description
- Examples of interactions

### 4. Makefile Enhancements

Updated `make dev` command to show file organization examples:

- 5 categories of organization prompts
- Basic, project structure, content-based, advanced, cleanup
- Tips for using the agent
- Quick commands reference

## ADK Best Practices Applied

### ✅ Before-Tool Callback Usage

Following ADK guidelines for `before_tool_callback`:
1. **Validation**: Check arguments are safe
2. **Authorization**: Require approval for sensitive operations  
3. **Logging**: Track tool usage for audit
4. **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse (framework in place)

### ✅ Security by Design

- **Directory scoping**: Restrict MCP to specific directory
- **Least privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions
- **Fail-safe defaults**: Block destructive ops by default
- **Audit logging**: Log all operations

### ✅ User Experience

- **Clear messaging**: Explain why operations are blocked
- **Helpful guidance**: Show how to approve operations
- **Progressive disclosure**: Safe ops work immediately
- **Transparency**: Agent explains actions before execution

## Features Implemented

### 1. HITL Approval Workflow

- ✅ Before-tool callback intercepts every tool call
- ✅ Destructive operations classified and blocked
- ✅ Approval required via state flag
- ✅ Clear user messaging on blocked operations
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for audit

### 2. Directory Restriction

- ✅ Default to `sample_files/` directory
- ✅ Absolute path resolution for security
- ✅ Auto-create sample_files if missing
- ✅ MCP server cannot access parent directories
- ✅ System files completely off-limits

### 3. Operation Classification

**Safe Operations (no approval needed)**:
- read_file
- read_text_file  
- list_directory
- search_files
- get_file_info

**Destructive Operations (approval required)**:
- write_file
- write_text_file
- move_file
- create_directory

### 4. Enhanced Documentation

- ✅ README updated with HITL explanation
- ✅ Security features section added
- ✅ Usage examples for approval workflow
- ✅ Makefile shows file organization examples
- ✅ Agent instructions explain HITL to users

## Testing Results

All 39 tests passing with new HITL implementation:

```bash
$ make test
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 39 items

tests/test_agent.py::TestAgentConfig::test_root_agent_exists PASSED      [  2%]
tests/test_agent.py::TestAgentConfig::test_agent_has_correct_model PASSED [  5%]
...
tests/test_structure.py::TestFileContent::test_pyproject_toml_has_package_name PASSED [100%]

======================== 39 passed in 2.67s =========================
```

## Usage Examples

### Approve File Operations

```python
# Via ADK state (programmatic)
state['user:auto_approve_file_ops'] = True

# Or implement UI approval workflow in production
# using ADK's event system and callback mechanisms
```

### Try HITL in Action

```bash
# Start agent
make dev

# Try safe operation (works immediately)
"List all files in sample_files"

# Try destructive operation (blocked)
"Create a new file called test.txt"
# Response: "⚠️ APPROVAL REQUIRED - Operation has been BLOCKED for safety"

# Approve and retry
# Set state['user:auto_approve_file_ops'] = True in ADK UI
"Create a new file called test.txt"
# Response: "✅ File created successfully"
```

## Security Benefits

### 1. Prevent Accidental Damage

- User must explicitly approve file modifications
- Cannot accidentally delete important files
- System files are completely inaccessible

### 2. Audit Trail

- All tool calls logged with arguments
- Track who approved what operations
- Compliance-ready logging

### 3. Least Privilege

- Agent only has access to sample_files/
- Cannot escape to parent directories
- MCP server enforces directory boundary

### 4. Defense in Depth

- Multiple layers of protection:
  1. Directory scoping (MCP server level)
  2. Before-tool callback (ADK level)
  3. User approval (Application level)

## Production Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Per-User Directories

```python
def create_user_agent(user_id: str) -> Agent:
    """Create agent with user-specific directory access."""
    user_dir = f"/data/users/{user_id}/files"
    return create_mcp_filesystem_agent(
        base_directory=user_dir,
        enable_hitl=True
    )
```

### Pattern 2: Role-Based Access

```python
def before_tool_callback(context, tool_name, args):
    """Check user role before allowing operations."""
    user_role = context.state.get('user:role')
    
    if tool_name in ADMIN_OPERATIONS and user_role != 'admin':
        return {'status': 'forbidden', 'message': 'Admin access required'}
    
    return None
```

### Pattern 3: Approval Queue

```python
def before_tool_callback(context, tool_name, args):
    """Queue destructive operations for async approval."""
    if tool_name in DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS:
        approval_id = queue_approval_request(tool_name, args)
        return {
            'status': 'pending_approval',
            'approval_id': approval_id,
            'message': 'Operation queued for approval'
        }
    return None
```
