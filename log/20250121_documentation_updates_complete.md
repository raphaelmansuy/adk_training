# Documentation Updates - Real Evaluation Implementation

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Files Updated**: 2

## Summary

Updated both the TIL documentation and README to reflect the **real evaluation implementation** that now uses `AgentEvaluator.evaluate()` with RUBRIC_BASED_TOOL_USE_QUALITY_V1 metric.

## Files Updated

### 1. `/docs/til/til_rubric_based_tool_use_quality_20251021.md`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced basic configuration example with real `AgentEvaluator.evaluate()` example
- ✅ Added comprehensive "Complete Working Implementation" section
- ✅ Included `make evaluate` command output and explanation
- ✅ Explained what happens "under the hood" during evaluation
- ✅ Added detailed test execution examples
- ✅ Included complete working code that actually runs evaluation

**Key Additions:**
```markdown
### Quick Example: Running Real Evaluation
- Shows AgentEvaluator.evaluate() actual implementation
- Explains all 3 test cases (good/bad/partial)
- Shows LLM judge evaluation with Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Demonstrates output format with scores and comparisons
- Explains what success/failure means

### Complete Working Implementation
- `make setup` - Install dependencies
- `make test` - Run evaluation tests
- `make evaluate` - ⭐ RUN REAL EVALUATION (NEW!)
- Shows actual command output
- Explains all 4 rubrics used for evaluation
- Shows scoring results and interpretation
```

### 2. `/til_implementation/til_rubric_based_tool_use_quality_20251021/README.md`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added "Run Real Evaluation ⭐" section to Quick Start
- ✅ Explained what `make evaluate` does with actual output
- ✅ Detailed 5-step internal process
- ✅ Updated Commands section with detailed command descriptions
- ✅ Added "The `make evaluate` Command (NEW - Real Evaluation!)" section
- ✅ Rewrote "Integration with Your Own Agent" with real ADK patterns
- ✅ Enhanced "Evaluation Concepts" section with real-world examples

**Key Additions:**

**In Quick Start:**
```markdown
### Run Real Evaluation ⭐

make evaluate

This **actually calls the ADK evaluation framework** to evaluate tool sequencing:
- Shows 3 test cases with tool sequences
- LLM judge evaluates against 4 custom rubrics
- Reports scores vs threshold (0.7 required)
- Shows expected vs actual tool calls (side-by-side)
```

**New Command Comparison Table:**
```markdown
| Command | Purpose | Output | API Calls |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| make demo | Show examples | Static demo | None |
| make dev | Interactive testing | Web UI | None (until chat) |
| make evaluate | Real assessment | Actual scores | ✅ LLM judge |
```

**Updated Integration Section:**
- Shows real AgentEvaluator API usage
- Includes complete flow example
- Demonstrates evalset.json structure
- Shows config with rubric-based metric

**Enhanced Evaluation Concepts:**
- Added "What the Real Evaluation Does" (5 steps)
- Included real-world example with scores
- Clear scoring ranges (0.0-1.0)
- Tool quality vs response quality comparison

## Content Updates Details

### TIL Documentation Updates

**Before:** Theoretical configuration example  
**After:** Real working evaluation with output

```markdown
# Before
# Quick Example
from google.adk.evaluation import LlmAsJudge, PrebuiltMetrics
# ... theoretical code

# After
# Quick Example: Running Real Evaluation
The ADK provides AgentEvaluator.evaluate() to run real evaluation:
# ... complete working example with actual output shown
```

### README Updates

**Before:** Generic integration patterns  
**After:** Real API usage with step-by-step examples

```markdown
# Before
# Integration with Your Own Agent
To evaluate your agent's tool use quality:
[Generic pattern]

# After
# Integration with Your Own Agent
To evaluate your agent's tool use quality using the same framework:
## Step 1: Define Your Rubrics
[Specific rubric_id, rubric_content structure]
## Step 2: Create Test Cases (evalset.json)
[Exact evalset.json structure]
## Step 3: Run Evaluation
[Real AgentEvaluator.evaluate() call]
## Real-World Example (Complete Flow)
[Full working async function]
```
