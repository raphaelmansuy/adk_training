# Build Fix - Comments Import Errors Resolved

## Problem
The production build was failing with errors:
```
Expected component `Comments` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.
```

**Affected Files (4):**
- `/adk_training/docs/mcp_integration` (16_mcp_integration.md)
- `/adk_training/docs/nextjs_adk_integration` (30_nextjs_adk_integration.md)
- `/adk_training/docs/react_vite_adk_integration` (31_react_vite_adk_integration.md)
- `/adk_training/docs/ui_integration_intro` (29_ui_integration_intro.md)

## Root Cause
When the Comments component was added to all 35 tutorials, 4 files had their imports placed **inside code blocks** showing example code, rather than at the top of the MDX file after frontmatter.

**Example of the bug:**
```typescript
// Line 257 in 31_react_vite_adk_integration.md - WRONG LOCATION
export default defineConfig({
  // ... config ...
})

import Comments from '@site/src/components/Comments';  // ❌ Inside code block!
```

Should have been:
```typescript
// Line 10-11 - RIGHT LOCATION
---
id: react_vite_adk_integration
---

import Comments from '@site/src/components/Comments';  // ✅ After frontmatter
```

## Solution Implemented

### File 1: `16_mcp_integration.md`
- ✅ Added import at top (after frontmatter, line 10)
- ✅ Removed import from code block (was inside JavaScript example at line 714)

### File 2: `29_ui_integration_intro.md`
- ✅ Added import at top (after frontmatter, line 10)
- ✅ Removed import from code block (was inside React example at line 269)

### File 3: `30_nextjs_adk_integration.md`
- ✅ Added import at top (after frontmatter, line 10)
- ✅ Removed import from code block (was inside TypeScript example at line 570)

### File 4: `31_react_vite_adk_integration.md`
- ✅ Added import at top (after frontmatter, line 10)
- ✅ Removed import from code block (was inside vite.config.ts example at line 257)

## Build Results

**Before Fix:**
```
Error: Docusaurus static site generation failed for 4 paths:
- "/adk_training/docs/mcp_integration"
- "/adk_training/docs/nextjs_adk_integration"
- "/adk_training/docs/react_vite_adk_integration"
- "/adk_training/docs/ui_integration_intro"
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ [SUCCESS] Generated static files in "build".
✅ sitemap.xml has been formatted with proper indentation
```

### Build Metrics
- Server compiled in 1.20s
- Client compiled in 2.97s
- Service Worker compiled in 3.57s
- Total: ~7 seconds
- Status: ✅ SUCCESS (no errors)

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Type |
|------|--------|------|
| docs/tutorial/16_mcp_integration.md | Moved import to top, removed from code block | Fixed |
| docs/tutorial/29_ui_integration_intro.md | Moved import to top, removed from code block | Fixed |
| docs/tutorial/30_nextjs_adk_integration.md | Moved import to top, removed from code block | Fixed |
| docs/tutorial/31_react_vite_adk_integration.md | Moved import to top, removed from code block | Fixed |

## Key Learnings

1. **MDX Import Rules**: Imports must be at the top of the file, after frontmatter, NOT inside code blocks
2. **Code Block Syntax**: When showing code examples, imports inside triple backticks (``` or ```tsx) are literal text, not executed imports
3. **Static Site Generation**: Docusaurus SSG requires all components to be properly imported for the build to succeed
4. **Comment Component**: The Comments component added to all tutorials now works correctly when properly imported

## Verification

✅ All 4 files verified with proper import placement
✅ Production build completes successfully
✅ No SSG errors for affected paths
✅ sitemap.xml generated correctly
✅ Ready for deployment
