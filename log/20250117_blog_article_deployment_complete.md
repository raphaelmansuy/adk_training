## Content Structure

### 1. Hook & Why Section (Lines 10-52)
- **Problem**: "You built an agent. Now what?"
- **Emotion**: Acknowledges overwhelm, confusion, conflicting advice
- **Solution Promise**: "Clarity, not complexity"

### 2. Why Deployment Matters (Lines 54-90)
- **Historical context**: Old way (complicated, needed DevOps)
- **Modern reality**: New way (simple, platform-first security)
- **Key insight**: "Platform-first security" concept
- **Tone**: Reassuring, demystifying

### 3. The Simple Truth (Lines 92-116)
- **Myth**: "You need a custom server"
- **Reality**: 80% of teams don't
- **Insight**: ADK's minimal server is intentional
- **When to break the rule**: Only 20% of cases need custom

### 4. Decision Framework with Mermaid (Lines 118-143)
```
✅ Interactive flowchart decision tree
✅ 5 major scenarios with color coding
✅ Recommendation boxes for each path
✅ Connects situation → platform → use case
```

**Diagram Features**:
- Cloud Run: Green (most common choice)
- Agent Engine: Blue (enterprise choice)
- GKE: Pink (Kubernetes option)
- Custom + Cloud Run: Orange (special needs)
- Local Dev: Gray (learning/development)

### 5. Real-World Scenarios (Lines 145-263)

**5 detailed scenarios** with specific recommendations:

1. **Startup (Moving Fast)**
   - ✅ Recommendation: Cloud Run
   - Time: 5 minutes
   - Cost: ~$40/mo
   - Why: Speed, cost, simplicity

2. **Enterprise (Need Compliance)**
   - ✅✅ Recommendation: Agent Engine (FedRAMP)
   - Time: 10 minutes
   - Cost: ~$50/mo
   - Why: Only platform with FedRAMP

3. **Kubernetes Shop**
   - ✅ Recommendation: GKE
   - Time: 20 minutes
   - Cost: $200-500+/mo
   - Why: Leverage existing infrastructure

4. **Custom Authentication Needs**
   - ⚙️ Recommendation: Custom + Cloud Run
   - Time: 2+ hours
   - Cost: ~$60/mo
   - Caveat: "Most teams don't need this"

5. **Developer (Local Testing)**
   - ⚡ Recommendation: Local Dev
   - Time: 1 minute
   - Cost: Free
   - Next step: Migrate to Cloud Run

### 6. Cost Reality Check (Lines 265-305)

**Visual cost comparison**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Cloud Run<br/>~$40/mo"]
    B["Agent Engine<br/>~$50/mo"]
    C["Custom + CR<br/>~$60/mo"]
    D["GKE<br/>$200-500+/mo"]
    E["Local Dev<br/>$0/mo"]
```

**Key points**:
- Based on 1M requests/month (typical startup)
- Model costs separate from deployment costs
- ROI analysis for each option
- When to upgrade paths

### 7. Security (Lines 307-360)

**What's automatic**:
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS (handled)
- ✅ DDoS protection (included)
- ✅ Encryption (automatic)
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning (built-in)

**What you must do**:
- Use Secret Manager for API keys
- Validate inputs
- Set resource limits
- Log important events
- Monitor error rates

**Code example**: Shows ❌ Don't vs ✅ Do for secrets management

### 8. Getting Started (Lines 362-411)

**Fast path**:
```bash
adk deploy cloud_run \
  --project your-project-id \
  --region us-central1
```

**Time**: 5 minutes
**Includes**: Setup checklist, testing steps, after-deploy tasks

### 9. Decision Tree (Lines 413-425)

**Quick reference**:
- Need compliance? → Agent Engine
- Have Kubernetes? → GKE
- Need custom auth? → Custom + Cloud Run
- Otherwise? → Cloud Run

### 10. Resources (Lines 427-456)

**Main Tutorial**:
- 📖 Tutorial 23 (GitHub blob link)

**Guides & Checklists**:
- 🔐 Security Verification Guide
