**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

Investigated GitHub Discussions "This content is blocked" error for the ADK Training
repository and provided comprehensive solution guide.

## Investigation Results

- Discussions URL: https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/adk_training/discussions
- Current Status: ✅ Accessible and working
- Display: Shows "Welcome to discussions!" message with 6 discussion categories

### Error Context
The "This content is blocked. Contact the site owner to fix the issue" error in
GitHub Discussions typically occurs in 5 main scenarios:

1. **Discussions Feature Not Enabled** (Most Common)
   - Solution: Settings → Features → Check Discussions box

2. **Missing Community Standards**
   - Solution: Add Code of Conduct, README, License

3. **Insufficient User Permissions**
   - Solution: Verify user access level and repository visibility

4. **Organization-Level Restrictions**
   - Solution: Enable discussions at organization level

5. **GitHub Enterprise Restrictions**
   - Solution: Contact Enterprise Administrator

### Root Causes Analysis

The blocking error is NOT a bug but a feature control mechanism that prevents
access when:
- Discussions feature is disabled in repository settings
- Community guidelines/standards are not established
- User lacks proper permissions (Read/Write/Admin)
- Repository is private and user lacks access
- Organization or Enterprise policies restrict discussions
