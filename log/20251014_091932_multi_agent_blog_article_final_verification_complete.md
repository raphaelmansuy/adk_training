## Summary
Completed final verification of the multi-agent patterns blog article against official Google ADK patterns from tutorials 04, 06, and 17. All code examples now match ADK standards and are technically accurate.

## Changes Made
- Verified all Agent instantiations include required parameters (name, model, description, instruction, tools, output_key)
- Confirmed SequentialAgent usage matches Tutorial 04 patterns with proper sub_agents parameter
- Validated RemoteA2aAgent implementation follows Tutorial 17 with correct agent_card_url construction
- Ensured all FunctionTool implementations return proper {'status': str, 'report': str, 'data': result} format
- Checked that state management uses correct output_key and {key} interpolation syntax
- Confirmed all imports match official ADK module structure

## Verification Results
✅ **Agent Instantiation**: All agents properly instantiated with required parameters
✅ **SequentialAgent**: Correct usage with sub_agents list for sequential execution
✅ **RemoteA2aAgent**: Proper A2A communication setup with agent card URLs
✅ **FunctionTool**: All tools return structured dicts with status/report/data fields
✅ **State Management**: output_key and {key} interpolation working correctly
✅ **Imports**: All using official ADK module paths

## Technical Accuracy Confirmed
Every line of code in the blog article now follows official Google ADK patterns as demonstrated in the working tutorial implementations. The article provides accurate, production-ready examples for multi-agent system development.
