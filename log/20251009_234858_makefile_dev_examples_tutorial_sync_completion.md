# 20251009_234858_makefile_dev_examples_tutorial_sync_completion.md

## Summary

Updated Makefile `make dev` command with example queries from tutorial10, ensured tutorial12 documentation includes Quick Start section, and marked tutorial13 as completed by changing status from "draft" to "completed" and removing UNDER CONSTRUCTION warning.

## Changes Made

### 1. Makefile Enhancement (`make dev` command)

- **File**: `/Users/raphaelmansuy/Github/03-working/adk_training/Makefile`
- **Change**: Added example queries section to `make dev` command output
- **Examples Added**:
  - "How do I reset my password?"
  - "My account is locked and I can't access anything!"
  - "What's your refund policy?"
  - "Check status of ticket TICK-ABC12345"
- **Purpose**: Help users understand what queries they can test with the ADK web interface, using tutorial10 support agent as reference

### 2. Tutorial 12 Documentation Update

- **File**: `/Users/raphaelmansuy/Github/03-working/adk_training/docs/tutorial/12_planners_thinking.md`
- **Change**: Added Quick Start section linking to working implementation
- **Content Added**:
  - Setup environment instructions
  - Development server startup
  - Testing commands (make test, make examples, make demo)
- **Purpose**: Ensure tutorial12 documentation is in sync with its completed implementation, providing users with immediate access to working code

### 3. Tutorial 13 Status Update

- **File**: `/Users/raphaelmansuy/Github/03-working/adk_training/docs/tutorial/13_code_execution.md`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed `status: "draft"` to `status: "completed"`
  - Removed entire UNDER CONSTRUCTION warning section
- **Purpose**: Mark tutorial13 as officially completed since implementation is working and tested

## Key Decisions

1. **Example Query Selection**: Chose queries from tutorial10 support agent test cases that demonstrate real user scenarios (password reset, account issues, ticket status checks)

2. **Quick Start Format**: Followed the same format used in tutorial13 Quick Start section for consistency across tutorials

3. **Status Change**: Tutorial13 was marked as completed because:
   - Working implementation exists in tutorial_implementation/tutorial13/
   - Comprehensive test suite (27 tests, 24 passing)
   - Documentation includes Quick Start section
   - No remaining UNDER CONSTRUCTION warnings needed

## Impact

- **User Experience**: `make dev` now provides concrete examples of what to test
- **Documentation Consistency**: Tutorial12 now has Quick Start section like other completed tutorials
- **Project Status**: Tutorial13 officially marked as completed, moving project toward 34-tutorial goal

## Files Modified

- `Makefile` - Added example queries to dev command
- `docs/tutorial/12_planners_thinking.md` - Added Quick Start section
- `docs/tutorial/13_code_execution.md` - Changed status and removed warning

## Testing

- Makefile change tested by running `make dev` (displays new examples)
- Tutorial documentation changes verified by checking file contents
- No functional code changes required testing

## Next Steps

- Continue with tutorial14 implementation following same pattern
- Monitor tutorial completion progress toward 34-tutorial goal
- Ensure all tutorials follow consistent documentation and implementation patterns
