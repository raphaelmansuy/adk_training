# Tutorial 19: Fixed Artifact Storage to Actually Work

## Problem Identified
The agent was running in the ADK web interface, but the **Artifacts tab showed nothing** because the tools were just returning mock data instead of actually saving/loading artifacts from the ADK artifact service.

## Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation had tools that:
- Returned dictionaries with 'artifact_part' fields but never called `save_artifact()`
- Returned mock content instead of calling `load_artifact()`
- Did not have access to `ToolContext` to interact with the artifact service
- Were synchronous functions that couldn't use async artifact API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Made All Tools Async and Added ToolContext
**Before:**
```python
def extract_text_tool(document_content: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ... returns mock data ...
```

**After:**
```python
async def extract_text_tool(document_content: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Actually saves to artifact service
    version = await tool_context.save_artifact(filename='document_extracted.txt', part=text_part)
```

### 2. Updated All Tool Functions
- `extract_text_tool`: Now actually saves extracted text as artifact
- `summarize_document_tool`: Loads from artifacts if no text provided, saves summary
- `translate_document_tool`: Saves translations as artifacts
- `create_final_report_tool`: Loads all artifacts and combines them in report
- `list_artifacts_tool`: Returns real artifacts from artifact service
- `load_artifact_tool`: Actually loads artifacts from storage

### 3. Updated All Tests
- Added `mock_tool_context` pytest fixture with AsyncMock
- Converted all test methods to async (`@pytest.mark.asyncio`)
- Updated test assertions to verify actual artifact service calls
- All 36 tests passing

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- `artifact_agent/agent.py`:
  - Imported `ToolContext` from `google.adk.tools.tool_context`
  - Converted all 6 custom tools to async functions
  - Added `tool_context` parameter to all tools
  - Replaced mock returns with actual `await tool_context.save_artifact()` calls
  - Added real artifact loading with `await tool_context.load_artifact()`

- `tests/test_tools.py`:
  - Added AsyncMock for ToolContext
  - Converted all tests to async
  - Added proper mocking for artifact service operations

## Validation Results
- ✅ All 36 tests pass
- ✅ Agent loads successfully in ADK web interface
- ✅ Tools now properly interact with ADK artifact service
- ✅ Artifacts will now appear in the Artifacts tab when used

## How Artifacts Now Work

### User Flow:
1. User sends: "Process this document: The quick brown fox..."
2. Agent calls `extract_text_tool()` →  Saves as `document_extracted.txt` v0
3. User: "Summarize it"
4. Agent calls `summarize_document_tool()` → Loads v0, creates summary, saves as `document_summary.txt` v0
5. User: "Show artifacts"
6. Agent calls `list_artifacts_tool()` → Returns actual list from artifact service
7. **Artifacts tab now shows the saved files**

### Artifact Service Integration:
```
User Request → Agent → Tool with ToolContext
                ↓
      await tool_context.save_artifact()
                ↓
      InMemoryArtifactService / GcsArtifactService
                ↓
      Artifact stored with versioning
                ↓
      ADK Web UI "Artifacts" tab displays files
```

## Next Steps
The artifacts will now be visible in the ADK web interface when users process documents. The agent can:
- Save documents with automatic versioning (v0, v1, v2, ...)
- Load specific versions or latest version
- List all available artifacts
- Combine artifacts into reports

## Testing in Web UI
Try these prompts to see artifacts appear:
1. "Process this document: [paste any text]"
2. "List all artifacts" 
3. "Summarize the extracted text"
4. "Create a final report"
5. Click "Artifacts" tab to see saved files
