# Tutorial 27 Enhanced Tools Demo - Complete

## Summary
Successfully enhanced Tutorial 27's Third-Party Tools Integration demo by adding multiple LangChain tools beyond just Wikipedia.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Web Search Tool
- Integrated `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` from LangChain for current web search capabilities
- No API key required, uses public DuckDuckGo search
- Added `create_web_search_tool()` function with proper ADK wrapping

### 2. Updated Agent Configuration
- Modified agent to use both Wikipedia and web search tools
- Updated description to highlight comprehensive research capabilities
- Enhanced instructions to guide agent on when to use each tool (Wikipedia for historical facts, web search for current events)

### 3. Enhanced Demo and Documentation
- Updated Makefile demo output to showcase both tools
- Added example queries for each tool type
- Updated development server prompts with diverse query examples

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Updated test suite to validate both tools
- Added `TestWebSearchTool` class with full test coverage
- Modified existing tests to expect 2 tools instead of 1
- All 24 tests passing successfully

### 5. Dependencies
- Added `ddgs>=0.3.0` to requirements.txt for DuckDuckGo functionality
- Maintained compatibility with existing LangChain and ADK versions

## Key Features Demonstrated
- ✅ Multiple LangChain tool integration
- ✅ Proper ADK `LangchainTool` wrapping for both tools
- ✅ No API keys required for either tool
- ✅ Strategic tool selection based on query type
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Updated documentation and examples

## Demo Queries Available
1. 'What is quantum computing?' (Wikipedia)
2. 'Latest AI developments this year' (Web search)
3. 'Tell me about Ada Lovelace' (Wikipedia)
4. 'Current news about space exploration' (Web search)
5. 'What is the history of artificial intelligence?' (Wikipedia)

## Files Modified
- `third_party_agent/agent.py`: Added web search tool and updated agent config
- `Makefile`: Updated demo and dev targets
- `requirements.txt`: Added ddgs dependency
- `tests/test_agent.py`: Comprehensive test updates for dual tools

## Testing Results
- All 24 tests pass
- Agent imports successfully
- Both tools properly registered and functional
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
- Could add calculator tool using LangChain math capabilities
- Could integrate CrewAI tools for even more variety
- Ready for production deployment with enhanced research capabilities
