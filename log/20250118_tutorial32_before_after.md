# Tutorial 32: Before and After Comparison

## Problem Summary

The Tutorial 32 documentation claimed to teach ADK integration with Streamlit, but actually only covered:
- Direct Gemini API calls (direct Python client, no ADK)
- Basic Streamlit UI patterns
- No mention of ADK concepts like Agents, Runners, or Tools

Meanwhile, the actual **implementation** (in `/tutorial_implementation/tutorial32/`) used sophisticated ADK patterns:
- Multi-agent system (analysis_agent.py + visualization_agent.py)
- ADK Runners for orchestration
- BuiltInCodeExecutor for dynamic visualization
- Proper session management

**Result**: Users learning from docs would be confused seeing the actual code.

├─ Getting Started (minimal setup)
├─ Building Your App
│  ├─ Level 1: Basic Chat (Gemini direct)
│  ├─ Level 2: Error Handling (still Gemini)

import genai
from google.genai.types import Tool, FunctionDeclaration

client = genai.Client(...)  # ❌ Direct Gemini API, not ADK

# Tool functions exist but never used by Agent class
def analyze_column(...):
    return {...}

# Response generation: Direct API call
response = client.models.generate_content_stream(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    contents=[...]  # ❌ No Agent orchestration
)

# Step 1: Create agents
from google.adk.agents import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="data_analysis_agent",
    tools=[analyze_column, calculate_correlation, filter_data]
)

# Step 2: Use ADK Runner
from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService

runner = Runner(agent=agent, session_service=InMemorySessionService())

# Step 3: Execute with Content/Part objects
from google.genai.types import Content, Part

message = Content(role="user", parts=[Part.from_text(text=prompt)])

async for event in runner.run_async(
    user_id="streamlit_user",
    session_id=session_id,
    new_message=message
):
    # Handle streaming agent responses
    if event.content and event.content.parts:
        for part in event.content.parts:
            if part.text:
                response += part.text
