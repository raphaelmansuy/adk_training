# TIL Article Enhanced with Visual Diagrams

## Overview
Updated `/docs/docs/til/til_pause_resume_20251020.md` with comprehensive visual diagrams to better illustrate pause/resume invocation concepts and workflows.

## Diagrams Added

### 1. State Restoration Flow (Resumption Process)
**Location**: After "How It Works - 2. State Restoration"
**Type**: Mermaid Flowchart
**Purpose**: Visual representation of the state restoration process when resuming invocations
**Shows**:
- Resume request entry point
- Session & invocation ID retrieval
- Previous invocation events loading
- Agent state extraction
- Validation steps
- State restoration to InvocationContext
- Final execution continuation

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop Sequence Diagram
**Location**: Use Case #2 - Human-in-the-Loop Approval
**Type**: Mermaid Sequence Diagram
**Purpose**: Shows the interaction between User, Agent, and Session Storage during human-in-the-loop workflows
**Shows**:
- User initiates invocation
- Agent processing and checkpoint creation
- State saved to storage
- Pause point awaiting input
- Human review and feedback
- Resume request with state restoration
- Continued execution and completion

### 3. Fault Tolerance Timeline
**Location**: Use Case #3 - Fault Tolerance
**Type**: Mermaid Timeline Diagram
**Purpose**: Illustrates system failure and recovery workflow
**Shows**:
- Normal execution with checkpoints
- System failure/crash event
- Event preservation in storage
- System downtime
- Recovery initiation
- State restoration from checkpoint
- Resumed execution
- Successful completion

### 4. Multi-Agent Handoff Flowchart
**Location**: Use Case #4 - Multi-Agent Workflows
**Type**: Mermaid Flowchart
**Purpose**: Shows state preservation across multiple agent handoffs
**Shows**:
- Invocation 1 with multiple agents
- Checkpoint and pause points
- State storage
- Invocation 2 resumption
- State restoration
- Handoff between agents
- Final completion
**Styling**: Color-coded states for clarity

### 5. Event Flow Lifecycle
**Location**: "Event Flow Example" section
**Type**: Mermaid Graph + Timeline
**Purpose**: Dual visualization of event flow with checkpoints
**Shows**:
- User message event
- Agent processing
- Checkpoint events with state
- Pause point
- Session storage
- Later resumption
- State restoration
- Event continuation
- Checkpoint lifecycle

### 6. State Lifecycle State Machine
**Location**: "State Lifecycle" section (new)
**Type**: Mermaid State Diagram
**Purpose**: Complete state transition lifecycle of pause/resume invocations
**Shows**:
- Configuration initialization
- Execution flow
- Processing states
- Checkpoint triggers
- State persistence decisions
- Continue vs. Pause paths
- Resumption flow
- State restoration
- Completion states
**Includes**: Inline notes explaining key transitions
