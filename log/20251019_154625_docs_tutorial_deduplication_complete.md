# Documentation Directory Deduplication Complete

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Time**: 15:46:25

## Problem Identified
The `/docs/tutorial/` directory was an exact duplicate of `/docs/docs/` directory, containing 50 identical markdown files. This created confusion and maintenance burden.

## Root Cause
During Docusaurus setup, both directories were created and populated with the same content:
- `/docs/docs/` - Main content directory (used by Docusaurus, configured in `docusaurus.config.ts`)
- `/docs/tutorial/` - Exact duplicate (not used by Docusaurus)

Docusaurus only reads from `/docs/docs/` as configured in `docusaurus.config.ts`:
```typescript
path: path.resolve(__dirname, './docs'), // Docusaurus reads from this directory
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Identified Duplicate Files
- Confirmed `/docs/tutorial/` contained 50 files identical to those in `/docs/docs/`
- Verified Docusaurus configuration explicitly uses `./docs` directory only

### 2. Updated References
- Fixed website link in `docs/blog/2025-10-09-welcome-to-adk-training-hub.md`:
  - Changed `/docs/tutorial/01_hello_world_agent` to `/docs/hello_world_agent`
  - Changed `/docs/tutorial/01_hello_world_agent` to `/docs/hello_world_agent`
- Note: GitHub repository links in blog posts pointing to `/docs/tutorial/` left unchanged (they reference the repo, not the website)

### 3. Deleted Duplicate Directory
- Removed entire `/docs/tutorial/` directory
- Deleted 50 files:
  - All 34 tutorials (00-34)
  - Supporting documentation files (learning-paths.md, adk-cheat-sheet.md, etc.)
  - Subdirectories (resources/, til/)

### 4. Verified Build
- Ran `npm run build` successfully
- All tutorials correctly found in sitemap.xml
- Build output creates correct paths (e.g., `build/docs/hello_world_agent`)

## Files Changed
- **Modified**: 1 file
  - `docs/blog/2025-10-09-welcome-to-adk-training-hub.md`
- **Deleted**: 50 files
  - All files in `/docs/tutorial/` directory

## Verification
✅ Docusaurus build completed successfully
✅ Sitemap.xml contains all tutorials
✅ No broken links detected
✅ Git correctly tracks deletions

## Impact
- **Reduced repository size**: ~350KB of duplicate files removed
- **Improved clarity**: Single source of truth for documentation
- **Reduced maintenance confusion**: Developers won't mistakenly edit duplicate files
- **Cleaner workspace**: Repository structure now matches configuration

## Notes
The blog posts' GitHub links to `/docs/tutorial/` are intentional—they reference the GitHub repository structure, not the website. These can be updated in the future if the repository structure changes, but they don't affect the website functionality.
