# 20251010_114656_tutorial17_adk_discovery_fix_complete

## Summary
Fixed ADK web interface discovery issue where remote A2A servers were being incorrectly loaded as ADK agents.

## Problem
ADK was scanning all subdirectories and trying to load `research_agent`, `analysis_agent`, and `content_agent` as ADK agents, but these are A2A servers that should not have `root_agent` exports.

## Root Cause
The Makefile was installing remote agents as separate Python packages with `pip install -e ./remote_agent`, making them discoverable by ADK's agent loader.

## Solution
Removed the individual `pip install -e` commands for remote agents from the Makefile setup target. Remote agents are now run directly as modules (`python -m remote_agent`) without being installed as packages.

## Changes Made
- Modified `tutorial_implementation/tutorial17/Makefile`: Removed pip install commands for remote agents in setup target
- Dependencies are still available via main requirements.txt
- Remote agents still work as A2A servers via `make start-agents`

## Verification
- ADK web interface starts without discovery errors
- Remote agents can be started as modules
- A2A orchestrator functionality preserved
## Root Cause
The Makefile was installing remote agents as separate Python packages with `pip install -e ./remote(only main orchestrator is installed as package)
