# Research Summary: Data Visualization with ADK Code Execution

## Quick Answer: YES ✅

Data visualization **CAN** be implemented using ADK Code Execution, and it's officially supported with proven production examples.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Official Support from Google ADK

- **Tool**: `BuiltInCodeExecutor` and `code_executor` parameter in agents
- **Models**: Works with Gemini 2.0+ only
- **Status**: Production-ready with Vertex AI integration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive in official ADK docs

### 2. Real-World Example: ADK Data Science Sample

Google provides an official sample that demonstrates this:
- **Repo**: https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/data-science
- **Features**: Multi-agent data science system with visualization
- **Approach**: Agent generates Python code → executed in sandbox → returns plots
- **Example**: "Plot sales by country" → Agent writes matplotlib code → Code executes → Returns visualization

### 3. How It Works

```
User: "Show me sales by region"
  ↓
Agent (with code executor enabled)
  ↓
Agent generates: matplotlib.pyplot code
  ↓
Code Executor runs it safely
  ↓
Returns: Plot image + explanation
```

### 4. Three Execution Options

| Option | Use Case | Security | Setup |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **BuiltInCodeExecutor** | Local dev | Basic | Simple |
| **Vertex AI Code Interpreter** | Production | High | Medium |
| **GKE Executor** | Enterprise | Maximum | Complex |

## Comparison with Tutorial 32

### Tutorial 32 (Current - Direct Plotly)

```
✅ Fast (zero overhead)
✅ Simple to understand
✅ Streamlit focused
❌ Agent doesn't reason about viz
```

### Code Execution Approach

```
✅ Agent reasons about visualizations
✅ Flexible chart generation
✅ Self-documenting (code shows what was done)
❌ Higher latency
❌ More complex
❌ Can't mix with other tools in same agent
```

## For Tutorial 32

**Recommendation**: Keep current direct Plotly approach

**Why**:
- Tutorial focuses on Streamlit + ADK integration
- Direct visualization is faster and simpler
- Better user experience
- Already well-implemented

**Alternative**: Create Tutorial 33 for advanced code execution visualization

## Implementation if Desired

Would use multi-agent pattern:

```python
# Visualization agent (with code executor)
viz_agent = Agent(
    name="visualizer",
    code_executor=BuiltInCodeExecutor()
)

# Analysis agent (with tools)
analysis_agent = Agent(
    name="analyzer",
    tools=[data_tools]
)

# Root agent combines both
root = Agent(
    sub_agents=[
        AgentTool(agent=viz_agent),
        AgentTool(agent=analysis_agent)
    ]
)
```

## Bottom Line

✅ **YES, data visualization can be implemented with ADK Code Execution**

This is:
- Officially supported
- Production-ready
- Proven with real examples
- Flexible and powerful

But for Tutorial 32 (Streamlit focus):
- Current direct approach is better
- Optimal for learning
- Better performance
- Simpler to understand

Consider code execution for advanced features or new tutorials exploring dynamic visualization generation.
