# Tutorial 31 - Chart Visualization Debugging Session

## Date: October 15, 2025
## Status: IN PROGRESS - Enhanced Debug Logging Added

## Problem Statement
User reported: "It cool but I don't see any chart."

The agent successfully generates chart data (evidenced by text like "Okay, I've created a bar chart...") but the chart visualization does not appear in the sidebar.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What We Know
1. **Agent is working**: Agent responds to prompts and says it created charts
2. **Backend is running**: Port 8000 is active and responding
3. **Frontend is running**: Port 5173 is active (shown in screenshot)
4. **Tool is executing**: The `create_chart()` tool is being called successfully
5. **Event handling exists**: Code has TOOL_CALL_RESULT handler implemented

### What We Don't Know (Yet)
1. **Are TOOL_CALL_RESULT events being received?** Need to check console logs
2. **What is the exact event structure?** Need to see the actual JSON
3. **Is `chart_type` at the right level?** Could be nested differently
4. **Is the chart data being set?** State updates might not be triggering

## Investigation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Logging (COMPLETED)

Added comprehensive console logging to trace event flow:

```typescript
// Main event loop logging
console.log("üì° Received event:", jsonData.type, jsonData);

// TOOL_CALL_RESULT specific logging
console.log("üîß TOOL_CALL_RESULT Event Received!");
console.log("   Full event object:", JSON.stringify(jsonData, null, 2));
console.log("   Content type:", typeof jsonData.content);
console.log("   Content value:", jsonData.content);
console.log("   Parsed content:", resultContent);
console.log("   Has chart_type?:", !!resultContent.chart_type);

// When chart found
console.log("‚úÖ CHART DATA FOUND!");
console.log("   Chart type:", resultContent.chart_type);
console.log("   Set currentChart state");

// When chart NOT found
console.log("‚ùå No chart_type found in result");
console.log("   Result keys:", Object.keys(resultContent));
```

### Phase 2: Browser Testing (NEXT STEP)

**Instructions for User:**

1. **Hard Refresh Browser**
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Or clear browser cache completely

2. **Open Developer Console**
   - Press F12 or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac)
   - Click on "Console" tab
   - Keep it open and visible

3. **Test Chart Generation**
   - Upload `sample_sales_data.csv`
   - Type: "Create a bar chart of Product vs Revenue"
   - Watch console output carefully

4. **Capture Information**
   - Look for "üì° Received event:" lines
   - Look for "üîß TOOL_CALL_RESULT Event Received!"
   - Look for "‚úÖ CHART DATA FOUND!" or "‚ùå No chart_type found"
   - Take screenshot of console output

## Expected Event Flow

Based on AG-UI protocol documentation:

```
1. RunStarted event
   type: "RUN_STARTED"
   
2. TextMessageStart event
   type: "TEXT_MESSAGE_START"
   messageId: "msg-xxx"
   role: "assistant"
   
3. TextMessageContent events (streaming)
   type: "TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT"
   messageId: "msg-xxx"
   delta: "I" / " have" / " created" / ...
   
4. ToolCallStart event
   type: "TOOL_CALL_START"
   toolCallId: "tool-xxx"
   toolCallName: "create_chart"
   
5. ToolCallArgs events (streaming)
   type: "TOOL_CALL_ARGS"
   toolCallId: "tool-xxx"
   delta: argument JSON fragments
   
6. ToolCallEnd event
   type: "TOOL_CALL_END"
   toolCallId: "tool-xxx"
   
7. ToolCallResult event ‚≠ê (THIS IS WHERE CHART DATA IS!)
   type: "TOOL_CALL_RESULT"
   toolCallId: "tool-xxx"
   content: JSON string or object with chart data
   
8. TextMessageEnd event
   type: "TEXT_MESSAGE_END"
   messageId: "msg-xxx"
   
9. RunFinished event
   type: "RUN_FINISHED"
```

## Chart Data Structure

From `agent.py`, the `create_chart()` tool returns:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "report": "Generated bar chart for Revenue vs Product...",
  "chart_type": "bar",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["Widget A", "Widget B", "Widget C"],
    "values": [2400, 3200, 2800]
  },
  "options": {
    "x_label": "Product",
    "y_label": "Revenue",
    "title": "Revenue vs Product"
  }
}
```

This structure should appear in the `content` field of the TOOL_CALL_RESULT event.

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Events Not Reaching Frontend

**Symptoms:**
- No "üì° Received event:" logs in console
- No TOOL_CALL_RESULT events visible

**Possible Causes:**
- CORS blocking SSE stream
- Network error interrupting stream
- Backend not emitting events

**Solution:**
- Check Network tab for /api/copilotkit request
- Verify EventStream stays open
- Check backend logs for event emission

### Issue 2: Event Structure Different Than Expected

**Symptoms:**
- "üîß TOOL_CALL_RESULT Event Received!" appears
- "‚ùå No chart_type found in result" appears
- Keys logged don't include chart_type

**Possible Causes:**
- `content` field structure is nested differently
- `chart_type` is at a different path
- Tool result wrapped in additional layer

**Solution:**
- Examine "Result keys:" console output
- Check full event JSON structure
- Adjust parsing logic to match actual structure

### Issue 3: State Not Updating

**Symptoms:**
- "‚úÖ CHART DATA FOUND!" appears
- "Set currentChart state" appears
- But sidebar still doesn't show chart

**Possible Causes:**
- React state batch update issue
- Sidebar conditional rendering logic problem
- Chart render function error

**Solution:**
- Check for React errors in console
- Verify `currentChart` state in React DevTools
- Add logging in `renderChart()` function
- Check sidebar rendering conditions

### Issue 4: Chart Rendering Error

**Symptoms:**
- Chart data is received and state is set
- Sidebar appears but chart doesn't render
- Console shows Chart.js errors

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid data format for Chart.js
- Missing required properties
- Chart.js configuration error

**Solution:**
- Validate data structure matches Chart.js requirements
- Check for null/undefined values
- Test renderChart() in isolation
