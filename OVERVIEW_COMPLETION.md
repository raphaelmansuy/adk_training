## Key Mental Models Created

### 1. Agent = Human Worker System
```
Agent = Brain (Model) + Tools (Capabilities) + Memory (Context)
        + Instructions (Behavior) + Workflows (Process) + Supervision (Callbacks)
```

### 2. State vs Memory = RAM vs Hard Drive
- State: Short-term (session, user:, app:, temp:)
- Memory: Long-term (persistent across sessions)
- Artifacts: File storage

### 3. Three Workflow Patterns = Assembly Lines
- Sequential: Order matters (one after another)
- Parallel: Speed matters (fan-out/gather)
- Loop: Quality matters (iterative refinement)

### 4. Tool Ecosystem Hierarchy
- FunctionTool: Custom Python logic
- OpenAPIToolset: REST APIs
- MCPToolset: Standardized protocol
- Builtin Tools: Google Cloud capabilities
- Framework Tools: LangChain/CrewAI integration

### 5. Deployment = Environment Progression
- Local (adk web): Home office
- Cloud Run: Small office (serverless)
- Vertex AI: Corporate (managed)
- GKE: Factory (Kubernetes)

### 6. Grounding = Real-World Connection
- Web (google_search): Current facts
- Data (DB tools): Actual data
- Location (google_maps): Precise places
- Documents (RAG): Company knowledge

### 7. Streaming Modes
- SSE: Live TV (agent → user)
- BIDI: Video call (agent ↔ user)
- NONE: Recording (batch)

### 8. MCP = USB Protocol
- Before: Custom integrations everywhere
- After: One protocol, many servers

### 9. A2A = Microservices
- Monolithic: Everything in one agent
- A2A: Specialized agents via HTTP

### 10. Prompt = Program Model
- System/Instruction: Operating system
- Context: Program data
- User Message: Function call
- Tool Results: Return values

### 11-15. Additional Models
- Agent Hierarchy = Organizational Tree
- Thinking = Explicit Reasoning
- Observability = X-ray Vision
- Cost Optimization = Right Tool for Job
- Pattern Selection = Decision Trees

- Multi-provider LLM integration

### 2. Tool Selection Decision Tree
```
Need capability?
├─ Python code? → FunctionTool
├─ REST API? → OpenAPIToolset
├─ Filesystem/DB? → MCPToolset
├─ Web/Maps? → Builtin tools
└─ Third-party? → LangchainTool/CrewaiTool
```

### 3. Workflow Decision Matrix
| Scenario | Sequential | Parallel | Loop |
|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| Order matters | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Independent tasks | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Speed critical | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Quality > speed | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### 4. Cost Optimization Framework
- Model tiers (FREE Ollama → $0.375 gemini-2.5-flash → $18 claude-3-7-sonnet)
- Tiered selection strategy
- Caching strategies
- Prompt engineering
- Parallel execution

### 5. Deployment Decision Tree
```
Ready to deploy?
├─ Prototype? → adk web (local)
├─ Low traffic? → Cloud Run
├─ Enterprise? → Vertex AI Agent Engine
├─ Custom infra? → GKE
└─ API integration? → FastAPI server
```

### 6-8. Additional Frameworks
- Grounding decision framework
- Streaming mode selection
- Observability strategy (Dev/Test/Staging/Prod)

## The 10 Commandments of ADK

1. **Agent = System, not just LLM** - Always design complete systems
2. **State for short-term, Memory for long-term** - Use appropriate persistence
3. **Sequential when order matters, Parallel when speed matters** - Choose correctly
4. **Loop for quality, not logic** - Use for refinement only
5. **Ground everything that needs to be true** - Connect LLMs to reality
6. **Tools are capabilities, not afterthoughts** - Design tools with agents in mind
7. **Callbacks for control, not core logic** - Use for guardrails and monitoring
8. **Start simple, add complexity when needed** - Progressive enhancement
9. **Evaluate early, evaluate often** - Build quality in from day one
10. **Production ≠ Development** - Use persistent services in production
