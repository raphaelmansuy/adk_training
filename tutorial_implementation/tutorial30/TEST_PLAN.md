# Tutorial 30 Advanced Features Test Plan

## Test Date: 2025-01-13

### Backend Status
- ✅ Backend running on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Tools configured: search_knowledge_base, lookup_order_status, create_support_ticket, get_product_details, process_refund
- ✅ No import errors or undefined functions

### Frontend Status  
- ✅ Frontend running on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ useCopilotAction hooks properly configured for both Generative UI and HITL

## Feature Tests

### Feature 1: Generative UI (Product Cards)

**Backend Implementation:**
- Tool: `get_product_details(product_id: str)` 
- Returns: `{"status": "success", "report": "...", "product": {...}}`

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Hook: `useCopilotAction` with `available: "frontend"`
- Intercepts: `get_product_details` calls from backend
- Renders: Loading state → Simple completion message

**Test Cases:**
1. User message: "Show me product PROD-001"
   - Expected: Backend calls get_product_details("PROD-001")
   - Expected: Frontend shows loading animation
   - Expected: Agent response includes product information
   
2. User message: "Display product PROD-002"
   - Expected: Similar flow with PROD-002 data

3. User message: "Show me product PROD-999" (invalid)
   - Expected: Error message from backend

**Known Limitations:**
- Current implementation shows simple "Fetched product X" message
- ProductCard component is NOT automatically rendered (need to verify if this is expected behavior)
- May need to adjust implementation based on test results

### Feature 2: Human-in-the-Loop (Refund Approval)

**Backend Implementation:**
- Tool: `process_refund(order_id: str, amount: float, reason: str)`
- Returns: `{"status": "success", "report": "...", "refund": {...}}`

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Hook: `useCopilotAction` with `available: "enabled"` and `renderAndWaitForResponse`
- Intercepts: `process_refund` calls from backend
- Renders: Approval dialog with Cancel/Approve buttons
- Returns: `{"approved": bool}` to backend

**Test Cases:**
1. User message: "I want a refund for order ORD-12345"
   - Expected: Agent asks for amount and reason
   - User provides: "The product was damaged, refund $99.99"
   - Expected: Frontend shows approval dialog
   - User clicks: "✅ Approve Refund"
   - Expected: Backend processes refund, agent confirms success

2. User message: "Process refund for ORD-67890"
   - Expected: Agent asks for details
   - User provides details
   - Expected: Frontend shows approval dialog
   - User clicks: "❌ Cancel"
   - Expected: Refund cancelled, agent acknowledges cancellation

**Known Limitations:**
- Backend tool does NOT currently have returns schema defined
- May need to check if AG-UI protocol handles this automatically
- Might need to add explicit TOOL_REFERENCE with returns schema if HITL doesn't work

### Feature 3: Shared State (User Context)

**Backend Implementation:**
- No backend changes needed - reads from CopilotKit state

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Hook: `useCopilotReadable` with user data object
- Data: name, email, accountType, orders, memberSince

**Test Cases:**
1. User message: "What's my account status?"
   - Expected: Agent knows user is "John Doe" with "Premium" account
   
2. User message: "Show me my recent orders"
   - Expected: Agent mentions ORD-12345 and ORD-67890

3. User message: "When did I join?"
   - Expected: Agent mentions "2023-01-15"

## Testing Instructions

1. Open http://localhost:3001 in browser
2. Wait for chat interface to load
3. Test each feature systematically
4. Document actual results vs expected results
5. Note any errors in browser console or backend logs

## Next Steps After Testing

Based on test results:

### If Generative UI doesn't render ProductCard:
- Option A: Modify backend to return structured data that frontend can render
- Option B: Create a separate render tool in frontend that agent explicitly calls
- Option C: Use agent's markdown response to display product info (current approach)

### If HITL doesn't show approval dialog:
- Option A: Add TOOL_REFERENCE with returns schema to backend tool
- Option B: Check AG-UI protocol logs for missing return type info
- Option C: Verify CopilotKit version compatibility

### If Shared State doesn't work:
- Check useCopilotReadable value is being sent to backend
- Verify agent can access copilotkit.state in instructions
- Check AG-UI protocol for state sync

## Success Criteria

✅ **Minimum Success:**
- All three features demonstrate their core functionality
- No runtime errors in browser or backend
- User can interact with all features

✅ **Full Success:**
- Generative UI: ProductCard component renders automatically
- HITL: Approval dialog appears and user decision affects refund processing
- Shared State: Agent uses user context in responses without being explicitly told

## Documentation Updates Needed

After testing, update:
1. README.md with actual behavior
2. Advanced features documentation
3. Any limitations or known issues
4. Tutorial 30 documentation with accurate implementation details
