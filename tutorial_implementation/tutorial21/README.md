## Best Practices

### Image Optimization

- Keep images under 500KB
- Resize large images (max 1024px)
- Use JPEG for optimized size
- Convert RGBA to RGB when needed

### Multimodal Content

- Provide clear context for images
- Use structured query format
- Label multiple images clearly
- Test with various image formats

### Error Handling

- Validate file existence
- Check MIME types
- Handle PIL/Pillow gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Import errors for PIL/Pillow

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

**Issue**: Agent not found in ADK web

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Issue**: ADK tries to load directories as agents

- Solution: Use `_` prefix for non-agent directories (`_sample_images`)
- ADK automatically ignores directories starting with `_` or `.`
- Select `vision_catalog_agent` from the dropdown

**Issue**: Image format not supported

- Ensure file extension matches content
- Convert to PNG or JPEG
- Check MIME type detection

**Issue**: API key not set

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
```

## Performance Considerations

- Image optimization reduces API costs
- Batch processing for multiple images
- Cache analysis results when appropriate
- Monitor token usage for large images

## Limitations

- Maximum image size: ~20MB
- Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, WEBP, HEIC
- API rate limits apply
- Token limits for large images

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Image generation with Imagen
- [ ] Video frame analysis
- [ ] Real-time camera integration
- [ ] Advanced OCR capabilities
- [ ] Custom vision models
