# Install dependencies
make setup

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make coverage
```

### 3. Start Development

```bash
# Start ADK web interface
make dev

# The agent will be available at http://localhost:8000
# Select "vision_catalog_agent" from the dropdown
```

### 4. View Demo Instructions

```bash
# See example prompts
make demo
```

## Usage Examples

### Analyze Single Product Image

```python
from google.adk.agents import Runner
from vision_catalog_agent import root_agent

runner = Runner()
result = await runner.run_async(
    "Analyze sample_images/laptop.jpg and create a catalog entry",
    agent=root_agent
)
print(result.content.parts[0].text)
```

### Compare Multiple Images

```python
result = await runner.run_async(
    "Compare the laptop and headphones images in sample_images/",
    agent=root_agent
)
```

### Batch Process Products

The agent can analyze multiple products sequentially:

```python
result = await runner.run_async(
    "Analyze all images in sample_images/ directory",
    agent=root_agent
)
```

## Example Prompts

Try these in the ADK web interface:

### Using Uploaded Images (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this agent is by uploading images directly in the web UI:

1. **Upload and Analyze** (drag-and-drop or paste image):

   ```text
   Analyze this laptop image and create a catalog entry
   ```

   - Simply drag and drop an image into the chat
   - Or paste an image from your clipboard
   - The agent will automatically analyze the uploaded image

2. **Multiple Uploaded Images**:

   ```text
   Compare these two product images
   ```

   - Upload multiple images by dragging them together
   - The agent can compare and analyze them

3. **Professional Catalog**:

   ```text
   Create a professional product catalog entry for this item
   ```

   - Upload a product image
   - Get marketing-ready descriptions

### Using File Paths

If you have images saved locally, you can reference them by path:

1. **Basic Analysis**:

   ```text
   Analyze the laptop image and describe what you see
   ```

2. **Catalog Entry**:

   ```text
   Create a professional catalog entry for the headphones image
   ```

3. **Comparison**:

   ```text
   Compare the laptop and smartwatch images
   ```

4. **Batch Processing**:

   ```text
   Analyze all product images and generate catalog entries
   ```

### Automated Batch Analysis

For analyzing all sample images programmatically, use the provided script:

```bash
# Analyze all sample images with one command
python analyze_samples.py
```

This script will:
- Analyze all three sample product images (laptop, headphones, smartwatch)
- Generate professional catalog entries for each
- Display detailed visual analysis and market positioning
- Show results in a clean, formatted output

**Output includes**:
- Product identification and category
- Visual features (colors, design, materials)
- Quality indicators and construction details
- Distinctive features and selling points
- Market positioning and target audience
- Professional marketing-ready descriptions

**Example Output**:

```
================================================================================
Image 1/3: Professional Laptop (laptop.jpg)
Product ID: LAPTOP-001
================================================================================

Product Analysis: Professional Laptop (LAPTOP-001)

1. Product Identification: High-end laptop computer for professional use

2. Visual Features:
   - Color: Sleek silver/gray aluminum finish, black keyboard
   - Design: Modern, minimalist, thin profile (13-15 inch)
   - Materials: Aluminum alloy chassis, high-quality keyboard
   
3. Quality Indicators: Robust construction, smooth finish, sturdy hinge

4. Distinctive Features: Thin bezels, premium look, high-resolution display

5. Market Positioning: High-end segment for professionals and creatives

Catalog Entry:
[Professional marketing description follows...]
```

**Benefits**:
- One command analyzes all samples
- No manual web interface interaction needed
- Perfect for demonstrations and testing
- Generates production-ready catalog entries
- Shows agent's multimodal capabilities

### Synthetic Image Generation ‚≠ê NEW

Generate professional product mockups when you don't have real photos yet:

```bash
# Generate synthetic product images
python generate_mockups.py

# Or use the Makefile target
make generate
```

This feature uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** to create photorealistic product images from text descriptions.

**What gets generated**:
- Minimalist Desk Lamp (modern, aluminum, LED)
- Premium Leather Wallet (brown leather, gold stitching)
- Wireless Gaming Mouse (RGB lighting, ergonomic)

**In ADK Web Interface**:

```text
Generate a synthetic image of a minimalist desk lamp with brushed aluminum finish
```

The agent will:
1. Use `generate_product_mockup()` tool
2. Create a photorealistic product image
3. Save it to `_sample_images/`
4. Automatically analyze the generated image
5. Provide a professional catalog entry

**Use Cases**:
- üé® **Rapid Prototyping**: Test catalog designs before investing in photography
- üí° **Concept Visualization**: Show clients what products could look like
- üîÑ **Variations**: Generate multiple style/color variations quickly
- üìê **Layout Testing**: Create mockups for different aspect ratios
- üí∞ **Cost Savings**: No need for studio equipment or photographers

**Example Prompts**:
```text
‚Ä¢ "Generate a mockup of a premium leather backpack with laptop compartment"
‚Ä¢ "Create a synthetic image of a smart water bottle with LED display"
‚Ä¢ "Generate product photography for a minimalist wireless charger"
‚Ä¢ "Make a mockup of noise-canceling earbuds in matte black"
```

**Supported Styles**:
- Photorealistic product photography (default)
- Studio lighting with white/clean background
- Lifestyle/contextual photography
- Artistic/creative product shots
- Custom lighting and angles

**Aspect Ratios Available**:
- 1:1 (1024x1024) - Perfect for social media
- 16:9 (1344x768) - Wide product shots
- 4:3 (1184x864) - Standard product photos
- 3:2 (1248x832) - Professional photography
- And more (see Gemini 2.5 Flash Image docs)

GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
```

### Model Selection

Current models:

- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`: Latest with vision support
- Alternative: `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`

## Best Practices

### Image Optimization

- Keep images under 500KB
- Resize large images (max 1024px)
- Use JPEG for optimized size
- Convert RGBA to RGB when needed

### Multimodal Content

- Provide clear context for images
- Use structured query format
- Label multiple images clearly
- Test with various image formats

### Error Handling

- Validate file existence
- Check MIME types
- Handle PIL/Pillow gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Import errors for PIL/Pillow

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

**Issue**: Agent not found in ADK web

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Issue**: ADK tries to load directories as agents

- Solution: Use `_` prefix for non-agent directories (`_sample_images`)
- ADK automatically ignores directories starting with `_` or `.`
- Select `vision_catalog_agent` from the dropdown

**Issue**: Image format not supported

- Ensure file extension matches content
- Convert to PNG or JPEG
- Check MIME type detection

**Issue**: API key not set

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
```

## Performance Considerations

- Image optimization reduces API costs
- Batch processing for multiple images
- Cache analysis results when appropriate
- Monitor token usage for large images

## Limitations

- Maximum image size: ~20MB
- Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, WEBP, HEIC
- API rate limits apply
- Token limits for large images

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Image generation with Imagen
- [ ] Video frame analysis
- [ ] Real-time camera integration
- [ ] Advanced OCR capabilities
- [ ] Custom vision models
