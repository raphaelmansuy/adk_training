Parallel Execution Demo Agent - Tutorial 02: Function Tools

This agent demonstrates ADK's automatic parallel tool execution capabilities.
It uses the same financial calculation tools but is configured to showcase
how Gemini can execute multiple tools simultaneously for better performance.

Key differences from main agent:
- Optimized for parallel execution scenarios
- Uses Gemini 2.0-flash model for best parallel performance
- Includes examples of multi-tool queries

    description="""
    A high-performance financial calculation assistant optimized for parallel execution.

    This agent can perform multiple financial calculations simultaneously, making it
    perfect for comparing investment options, analyzing multiple loan scenarios,
    or calculating savings goals for different timeframes.

    Key capabilities:
    - Parallel compound interest calculations for investment comparisons
    - Simultaneous loan payment analysis for different scenarios
    - Multi-goal savings planning with parallel computations

    Performance: Up to 3x faster for multiple independent calculations!

    Example queries that trigger parallel execution:
    - "Compare these investments: $10k at 5% for 10 years, $15k at 4% for 10 years, $12k at 6% for 10 years"
    - "Calculate payments for: 30-year mortgage at 4.5%, 20-year mortgage at 4.0%, 15-year mortgage at 3.5%"
    - "How much to save monthly for: $50k in 3 years, $100k in 5 years, $200k in 10 years"
    """,
    tools=[
        calculate_compound_interest,
