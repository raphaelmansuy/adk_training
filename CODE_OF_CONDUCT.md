# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and
harassment-free environment for everyone in our community, regardless of
age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces including our GitHub
repository, discussions, issues, pull requests, and any related
communication channels.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- **Being respectful and inclusive**: Treat all community members with
  kindness, respect, and consideration.
- **Being collaborative**: Work together constructively, share knowledge,
  and help others learn.
- **Providing constructive feedback**: Offer helpful, specific, and
  actionable feedback on code and ideas.
- **Accepting criticism gracefully**: Welcome feedback and engage in
  respectful dialogue about ideas and improvements.
- **Focusing on what is best**: Consider what will benefit the entire
  community, not just yourself.
- **Showing empathy**: Be understanding when people make mistakes or have
  different perspectives.
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**: Avoid assumptions about
  others' backgrounds or experiences.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment and discrimination**: Any unwelcome conduct based on
  protected characteristics or personal attacks.
- **Trolling and bad-faith engagement**: Deliberately antagonizing others
  or disrupting discussions.
- **Inappropriate content**: Sharing sexually explicit, violent, hateful,
  or otherwise offensive material.
- **Doxxing and privacy violations**: Sharing others' private information
  without consent.
- **Spam and self-promotion**: Excessive promotional content or
  off-topic spam.
- **Gatekeeping**: Making others feel unwelcome or excluding them based
  on experience level.
- **Dismissing or silencing**: Intentionally ignoring valid perspectives
  or making others feel unheard.

## Learning-Focused Community

This is an **educational community** dedicated to learning Google Agent
Development Kit (ADK) and AI agent development. We recognize that:

- **Everyone is learning**: Members have varying levels of experience,
  and that's encouraged.
- **Questions are valued**: Asking questions is part of the learning
  processâ€”never discourage someone for asking.
- **Mistakes are opportunities**: Code reviews and feedback are about
  improving together, not judgment.
- **Diverse perspectives help**: Different experiences and approaches
  strengthen our collective learning.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Document the incident**: Note the date, time, location, people
   involved, and what happened.
2. **Report it**: Contact the project maintainers at the email provided in
   the repository or through GitHub's private security vulnerability
   disclosure.
3. **Provide context**: Share as much detail as possible to help us
   understand and respond appropriately.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly. The identity of
the reporter will be protected, and retaliation is strictly prohibited.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:

- A private warning or conversation
- A public request to stop the behavior
- Temporary or permanent removal from the community
- Blocking or banning from repository participation

Our primary goal is to educate and correct behavior. However, we reserve
the right to take appropriate action to maintain a safe and inclusive
community.
